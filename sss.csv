1,1,Introduction,"According to the ancient and revered custom, Hemadpant begins
the work, Shri Sai Satcharita, with various salutations.
(1) First, he makes obeisance to the God Ganesh1 to remove all
obstacles and make the work a success, and says that Sri Sai is God
Ganesh Himself.
(2) Then, to goddess Saraswati2 to inspire him to write the work
and says that Shri Sai is one with this Goddess, and that He is Himself
singing His own life.
(3) Then, to the Gods; Brahma, Vishnu and Shankar – the Creating,
Preserving and Destroying deities respectively, and says that Sainath is
one with them and He, the great teacher, will carry us across the river
of worldly existence.
(4) Then, to his tutelary deity Narayan Adinath, who manifested
himself in Konkan – the land reclaimed by Parashurama3, (Ram in the
Hindi version) from the sea; and to the Adi (Original) Purush4 of the
family.
(5) Then, to Bharadwaj Muni, into whose gotra (clan) he was born
and also to various Rishis, Yagnyavalkya, Bhrugu, Parashar, Narad,
Vedavyas, Sanak, Sanandan, Sanatkumar, Shuka, Shounak,
Vishwamitra, Vasishtha, Valmiki, Vamadev, Jaimini, Vaishampayan,
Nava Yogindra etc; and also modern saints, such as Nivrutti, Dnyanadev,
Sopan, Muktabai, Janardan, Eknath, Namdev, Tukaram, Kanha, and
Narahari etc.
(6) Then, to his grandfather, Sadashiv, father Raghunath, his
mother, who left him in his infancy; to his paternal aunt, who brought
him up, and to his loving elder brother.
(7) Then, to the readers and prays to them to give their whole and
undivided attention to his work.
(8) And lastly, to his Guru Shri Sainath – an Incarnation of Shri
Dattatreya, Who is his sole refuge and Who will make him realize, that
Brahma is the reality and the world an illusion; and incidentally, to all
beings, in whom the Lord God dwells.
After describing in brief the various modes of devotion according
to Parashar, Vyasa and Shandilya etc., the author goes on to relate the
following story :
“It was some time after 1910 that I went, one fine morning, to the
Masjid in Shirdi to have darshan of Sai Baba. I was wonder-struck to
see the following phenomenon. After washing His mouth and face, Sai
Baba began to make preparations for grinding wheat. He spread a sack
on the floor, and thereon set a hand-mill. He took some quantity of
wheat in a winnowing fan, and then, drawing up the sleeves of His
kafni (robe), and taking hold of the peg of the hand-mill, started grinding
the wheat, by putting a few handfuls of wheat in the upper opening of
the mill and rotated it. I thought, “What business Baba had with the
grinding of wheat, when He possessed nothing and stored nothing,
and as He lived on alms!” Some people who had come there thought
likewise, but none had the courage to ask Baba, what He was doing.
Immediately, this news of Baba grinding wheat spread into the village,
and at once men and women ran to the Masjid and flocked there to see
Baba’s act. Four bold women, from the crowd, forced their way up and
pushing Baba aside, forcibly took the peg or handle into their hands,
and singing Baba’s Leelas started grinding. At first, Baba was enraged,
but on seeing the women’s love and devotion, He was much pleased
and began to smile. While they were grinding, they began to think that
Baba had no house, no property, no children, none to look after and He
lived on alms, and therefore, He did not require any wheat-flour for
making bread or roti, what will He do with this large quantity of flour?
Perhaps, as Baba is very kind, He will distribute the flour amongst us.
Thinking in this way and while singing, they finished the grinding and
after putting the hand-mill aside, they divided the flour into four portions
and began to remove them by taking one portion per head. Baba, Who
was calm and quiet up till now, got wild and started abusing them
saying, “Ladies, have you gone mad? Whose father’s property are you
looting away? Have I borrowed any wheat from you, so that you can
safely take the flour? Now, do this! Take the flour and throw it on the
village borders!” On hearing this, the women felt abashed and
whispering amongst themselves, went to the outskirts of the village and
spread the flour, as directed by Baba.
I asked the Shirdi people, “What was this that Baba did?” They
replied that, as cholera epidemic was spreading in the village this was
Baba’s remedy for the same; it was not wheat, that was ground, but
cholera itself was ground to pieces and pushed out of the village. From
this time onward, the cholera epidemic subsided and the people of the
village were happy. I was much pleased to know all this, but at the
same time my curiosity was also aroused. I began to ask myself ... What
earthly connection was there between wheat flour and cholera? What
was the causal relation between the two, and how to reconcile them?
The incident seems to be inexplicable. I should write something on this
and sing to my heart’s content Baba’s sweet leelas, thinking in this way
about this leela, my heart was filled with joy and I was thus, inspired
to write Baba’s life – The Sai Satcharita.
And as we know, with Baba’s grace and blessings this work was
successfully accomplished.
",
1,2,Philosophical Significance of Grinding,"Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, and the Ahankar, which is so subtle and
therefore, so difficult to get rid of.
This reminds us of a similar story of Kabir, who seeing a woman
grinding corn, said to his Guru, Nipatniranjan, “I am weeping, because
I feel the agony of being crushed under this wheel of worldly existence,
like the corn in the hand-mill.” Nipatniranjan replied, “Do not be
afraid, hold fast to the handle of knowledge of this mill, as I do, and
do not wander far away from the same, but turn inward to the centre,
and you are sure to be saved.”
Bow to Shri Sai — Peace be to all",
2,1,Introduction,"In the last chapter, the author mentioned in the original Marathi
book that he would state the reason that led him to undertake the work,
and about the persons qualified to read the same, and such other
points. Now, in this chapter, he narrates the same.",
2,2,The Object of Writing this Work,"In the first chapter, I described Sai Baba’s miracle of checking and
destroying the cholera epidemic by grinding wheat and throwing the
flour on the outskirts of the village. I heard other miracles of Sai Baba
to my great delight, and this delight burst forth into this poetic work.
I also thought that, the description of these miracles of Sai Baba would
be interesting and instructive to His devotees, and would remove their
sins, and so I began to write the sacred life and teachings of Sai Baba.
The life of the saint is neither logical nor dialectical. It shows us the true
and great path.",
2,3,Incapacity and Boldness in Undertaking the Work,"Hemadpant thought that, he was not a fit person to undertake the
work. He said, “I do not know the life of my intimate friend nor do I
know my own mind, then, how can I write the life of a saint or describe
the nature of Incarnations, which even the Vedas were unable to do?
One must be a saint himself before he could know other saints, otherwise,
how can I describe their glory? To write the life of a saint is most
difficult, one may as well be able to measure the depth of the seven seas
or enclose the sky with cloth-trappings. I knew, this was the most
venturous undertaking, which might expose me to ridicule. I, therefore,
invoked Sai Baba’s grace.
The premier poet – saint of Maharashtra, Shri Dnyaneshwar
Maharaj has stated that, the Lord loves those who write the lives of
saints, and the saints also have their own peculiar method of assigning
the service, which the devotees long for. The saint inspires the work, the
devotee becomes only an indirect cause or an instrument in achieving
the end. For instance, in 1700 Shaka year1, the poet Mahipati aspired
to write the lives of saints. Saints inspired him, and got the work done,
so also, in 1800 Shaka year2 Das Ganu’s service was accepted. The
former wrote 4 works – Bhakta Vijay, Sant Vijay, Bhakta Leelamrut and
Sant Leelamrut, while the latter wrote two – ‘Bhakta Leelamrut and
Sant Kathamrut’, in which the lives of modern saints were described.
In chapters 31, 32, 33 of Bhakta Leelamrut and in chapter 57 of Sant
Kathamrut, the life and teachings of Sai Baba are very well depicted.
These have been separately published in Sai Leela Magazine, Nos. 11
and 12, Vol. 17; the readers are advised to read these chapters. So also,
Sai Baba’s wonderful Leelas are described by Mrs. Savitribai Raghunath
Tendulkar of Bandra in a small book, named Sri Sainath Bhajan Mala.
Das Ganu Maharaj also has composed various sweet poems on Sai
Baba. A devotee, named Amidas Bhavani Mehta, has also published
some stories of Sai Baba in Gujarati; some nos. of Sainath Prabha, a
magazine published by Dakshina Bhiksha Sanstha of Shirdi, are also
published. Then, the question of objection comes in, that while so many
works regarding Sai Baba are extant, why should this (Satcharita) be
written; and where is its necessity?
The answer is plain and simple. The life of Sai Baba is as wide
and deep as the infinite ocean, and all can dive deep into the same and
take out precious gems (of knowledge and bhakti) and distribute them
among the aspiring people. The stories, parables and teachings of Sai
Baba are very wonderful. They will give peace and happiness to the
people, who are afflicted with sorrows and heavily loaded with miseries
of this worldly existence, and also bestow knowledge and wisdom, both
in worldly and in spiritual domains. If these teachings of Sai Baba,
which are as interesting and instructive as the Vedic lore, are listened
to and meditated upon, the devotees will get what they long for, viz.,
union with Brahma, mastery in eight-fold Yoga, bliss of meditation etc.
So, I thought that I should call these stories together, that would be my
best Upasana. This collection would be most delightful to those simple
souls, whose eyes were not blessed with Sai Baba’s darshan. So, I set
about collecting Sai Baba’s teachings and expressions – the outcome of
His boundless self-realization. It was Sai Baba, Who inspired me in this
matter, in fact, I surrendered my ego at His feet and thought that, my
path was clear; and that He would make me quite happy here, and in
the next world.
I could not myself ask Sai Baba to give me permission for this
work, so I requested Mr. Madhavrao Deshpande alias Shama, Baba’s
most intimate devotee, to speak to Him for me. He pleaded my cause
and said to Sai Baba, “This Annasaheb wishes to write Your biography,
don’t say that You are a poor Fakir, and there is no necessity to write
it; but if You agree and help him, he will write or rather, Your grace will
accomplish the work. Without Your consent and blessing, nothing can
be done successfully.” When Sai Baba heard this request, He was
moved and blessed me by giving me His Udi (sacred ash) and placing
His boon-bestowing hand on my head said, “Let him make a collection
of stories and experiences, keep notes and memos, I will help him. He
is only an outward instrument. I should write My autobiography
Myself and satisfy the wishes of My devotees. He should get rid of his
ego, surrender it at My feet. He, who acts like this in life, him I help the
most. What of My life-stories? I serve him in his house in all possible
ways. When his ego is completely annihilated and there is left no trace
of it, I Myself shall enter into him and shall Myself write My own life.
Hearing my stories and teachings will create faith in devotees’ hearts
and they will easily get self-realization and bliss; let there be no
insistence on establishing one’s own view, no attempt to refute other’s
opinions, no discussion of pros and cons of any subject.”",
2,4,Significant and Prophetic Title,"The word ‘discussion’ put me in mind of my promise to explain the
story of my getting the title of ‘Hemadpant’ and now, I begin to relate the
same. I was on close friendly terms with Kakasaheb Dixit and Nanasaheb
Chandorkar. They pressed me to go to Shirdi and have Baba’s darshan,
and I promised them to do so. But, something in the meanwhile turned
up, which prevented me from going to Shirdi. The son of a friend of mine
at Lonavala fell ill. My friend tried all possible means, physical and
spiritual, but the fever would not abate. At length, he got his Guru to sit
by the bed-side of his son, but this too was of no avail. Hearing this, I
thought... “What was the utility of the Guru, if he could not save my
friend’s son? If the Guru can’t do anything for us, why should I go to
Shirdi at all?” Thinking this way, I postponed my Shirdi-trip, but the
inevitable must happen, and it happened in my case as follows ... Mr.
Nanasaheb Chandorkar, who was a Divisional officer, was going on tour
to Bassein. From Thana he came to Dadar and was waiting for a train
bound for Bassein. Meanwhile, a Bandra Local turned up. He sat in it and
came to Bandra, and sent for me and took me to task for putting off my
Shirdi trip. Nana’s argument for my Shirdi trip was convincing and
delightful, and so I decided to start for Shirdi the same night. I packed up
my luggage and started for Shirdi. I planned to go to Dadar and from there
to catch the train for Manmad and so, I booked myself for Dadar and sat
in the train. While the train was to start, a Mohammeden came hastily to
my compartment and seeing all my paraphernalia, asked me where I was
bound to. I told him about my plan. He, then, suggested that I should go
straight to Boribunder, and not to wait at Dadar, as the Manmad Mail did
not stop at Dadar. If this little miracle or Leela had not happened, I would
not have reached Shirdi next day, as settled, and many doubts would
have assailed me. But, that was not to be. As fortune favoured me I
reached Shirdi the next day before 9 or 10 a.m. Bhausaheb (Kaka) Dixit
was waiting for me there. This was in 1910, when there was only one
place, viz., Sathe’s Wada, for lodging pilgrim devotees. After alighting
from the tonga I was anxious to have darshan, when the great devotee,
Tatyasaheb Noolkar returned from the Masjid and said that Sai Baba was
at the corner of the Wada and that, I should first get the preliminary
darshan and then, after bath see Him at leisure. Hearing this I ran and
prostrated before Baba and my joy knew no bounds. I found more than
what Nana Chandorkar had told me. All my senses were satisfied and I
forgot my thirst and hunger. The moment I touched Sai Baba’s feet, I began
a new lease of life. I felt myself much obliged to those, who spurred and
helped me to get the darshan, and I considered them as my real relatives,
and I cannot repay their debt. I only remember them and prostrate (mentally)
before them. The peculiarity of Sai Baba’s darshan, as I found it, is that
by His darshan our thoughts are changed, the force of previous actions
is abated and gradually non-attachment or dispassion towards worldly
objects grows up. It is by the merit of actions in many past births, that such
darshan is got; and if only you see Sai Baba, all the world assumes the
form of Sai Baba.",
2,5,Hot Discussion,"On the first day of my arrival in Shirdi, there was a discussion
between me and Balasaheb Bhate regarding the necessity of a Guru, I
contended, “Why should we lose our freedom and submit to others?
When we have to do our duty, why a Guru is necessary? One must try
his best and save himself. What can the Guru do to a man, who does
nothing but sleeps indolently?” Thus, I pleaded freewill, while Mr.
Bhate took up the other side, viz. destiny, and said, “Whatever is bound
to happen, must happen, even great men have failed; man proposes one
way, but God disposes the other way. Brush aside your cleverness,
pride or egoism won’t help you.” This discussion, with all its pros and
cons went on for an hour or so, and as usual no conclusion was arrived
at. We had to stop the discussion ultimately, as we were exhausted. The
net result of this was, that I lost my peace of mind and found that,
unless there is strong body-consciousness and egoism, there would be
no discussion, in other words, it is egoism which breeds discussion.
Then, when we went to the Masjid with others, Baba asked
Kakasaheb Dixit the following :
“What was going on in the (Sathe’s) Wada? What was the
discussion about?”, and staring at me, Baba further added, “What did
this ‘Hemadpant’ say?”
Hearing these words, I was much surprised. The Masjid was at
a considerable distance from Sathe Wada, where I was staying and
where the discussion was going on. How could Baba know our
discussion, unless, He be Omniscient and Inner Ruler of us all?
I began to think, why Sai Baba should call me by the name
‘Hemadpant’. This word is a distorted form of ‘Hemadripant’. This
Hemadripant was a wellknown minister of the kings, Mahadev and
Ramdev of Devgiri of the Yadav dynasty. He was very learned, goodnatured
and the author of works, such as Chaturvarga Chintamani
(dealing with spiritual subjects) and Rajprashasti. He invented and
started new methods of accounts and was the originator of the Moodhi
(Marathi shorthand) script. But, I was quite the opposite, an ignoramus
and of mediocre intellect. So, I could not understand, why the name or
title was conferred upon me, but thinking seriously upon it, I thought
that, the title was a dart to destroy my ego, so that, I should always
remain meek and humble. It was also a compliment paid to me for the
cleverness in the discussion.
Looking into history, we think that, Baba’s word (calling Mr.
Dabholkar by the name ‘Hemadpant’) was significant and prophetic, as
we find that, he looked after the management of Sai Sansthan very
intelligently, kept all the accounts properly and was also the author of
such a good work ‘Sai Satcharita’, which deals with such important
and spiritual subjects as Dhyan, Bhakti, dispassion, self-surrender and
self-realization.",
2,6,About the Necessity of a Guru,"Hemadpant has left no note, no memo about what Baba said
regarding this subject, but Kakasaheb Dixit has published his notes
regarding this matter. Next day, after Hemadpant’s meeting with Sai
Baba, Kakasaheb went to Baba and asked, “Baba, where to go?” Baba
said, “High up.” Then, the man said, “Where is the way?” Baba said,
“There are many ways leading there; there is one way from here (Shirdi)
also. The way is difficult. There are tigers and wolves in the jungles on
the way.” I (Kakasaheb) asked, “But, Baba, what, if we take a guide with
us?” Baba answered, “Then, there is no difficulty. The guide will take
you straight to your destination, avoiding wolves, tigers and ditches etc
on the way. If there be no guide, there is the danger of your being lost
in the jungles or falling into ditches.” Mr. Dabholkar was present on
this occasion and he thought that, this was the answer Baba gave to the
question, whether Guru was a necessity (Vide Sai Leela, Vol. I, No. 5,
page 47); and he, thereupon took the hint that, no discussion whether
man is free or bound, is of any use in spiritual matters, but on the
contrary real Paramartha is possible, only as the result of the teachings
of the Guru; as is illustrated in this chapter of the original work, in the
instances of great Avatars like Ram and Krishna, who had to submit
themselves to their Gurus, Vasishtha and Sandipani respectively, for
getting self-realization and that, the only virtues necessary for such
progress are faith and patience. (vide Sai Satcharita, Ch. II, 191-92)
Bow to Shri Sai — Peace be to all",
3,1,Sai Baba's Sanction and Promise,"As described in the previous chapter, Sai Baba gave His complete
assent to the writing of the Satcharita and said, “I fully agree with you
regarding the writing of Satcharita. You do your duty, don’t be afraid
in the least, steady your mind and have faith in My words. If My Leelas
are written, the Avidya (nescience) will vanish and if they are attentively
and devoutly listened to, the consciousness of the worldly existence
will abate and strong waves of devotion and love will rise up and if one
dives deep into My Leelas, he would get precious jewels of knowledge.”
Hearing this, the author was much pleased, and he, at once,
became fearless and confident, and thought that the work was bound
to be a success. Then, turning to Shama (Madhavrao Deshpande) Sai
Baba said, “If a man utters My name with love, I shall fulfill all his
wishes, increase his devotion. And if he sings earnestly My life and My
deeds, him I shall beset in front and back and on all sides. Those
devotees, who are attached to Me, heart and soul, will naturally feel
happiness, when they hear these stories. Believe Me that, if anybody
sings My Leelas, I will give him infinite joy and ever-lasting
contentment. It is My special characteristic to free any person, who
surrenders completely to Me, and who worships Me faithfully, and
who remembers Me, and meditates on Me constantly. How can they
be conscious of wordly objects and sensations, who utter My name,
who worship Me, who think of My stories and My life, and who thus,
always remember Me! I shall draw out My devotees from the jaws
of death. If My stories are listened to, all the diseases will be got rid
of. So, hear My stories with respect, and think and meditate on them,
assimilate them. This is the way of happiness and contentment. The
pride and egoism of My devotees will vanish, the mind of the hearers
will be set at rest; and if he has wholehearted and complete faith, he
will be one with Supreme Consciousness. The simple remembrance of
My name as “Sai, Sai” will do away with sins of speech and hearing.”",
3,2,Different Works Assigned to Devotees,"The Lord entrusts different works to different devotees. Some are
given the work of building temples and Maths, or Ghats (flight of steps)
on rivers; some are made to sing the glories of God, some are sent on
pilgrimages, but to me was allotted the work of writing the Sai Satcharita.
Being a jack of all trades, but master of none, I was quite unqualified
for this job. Then, why should I undertake such a difficult task? Who
can describe the true life of Sai Baba? Sai Baba’s grace alone can enable
one to accomplish this difficult work. So, when I took the pen in my
hand, Sai Baba took away my egoism and Himself wrote His stories.
The credit of relating these stories, therefore, goes to Him and not to
me. Though, Brahmin by birth, I lacked the two eyes (i.e. the sight or
vision) of Shruti and Smruti and therefore, was not at all capable of
writing the Satcharita, but the grace of the Lord makes a dumb man talk,
enables a lame man to cross a mountain. He alone knows the ways of
getting things done, as He likes. Neither the flute, nor the harmonium
knows, how the sounds are produced. This is the concern of the player.
The oozing of Chandrakant jewel and the surging of the sea are not, due
to the jewel and the sea, but due to the rising of the moon.",
3,3,Baba's Stories as Beacon Light,"Light-houses are constructed at various places in the sea, to enable
the boatmen to avoid rocks and dangers, and make them sail safely. Sai
Baba’s stories serve a similar purpose in the ocean of worldly existence.
They surpass nectar in sweetness, and make our worldly path smooth
and easy to traverse. Blessed are the stories of the saints. When they
enter our hearts through the ears, the body-consciousness or egoism
and the sense of duality vanish; and when they are stored in the heart,
doubts will evade, pride of the body will fall, and wisdom will be stored
in abundance. The description of Baba’s pure fame, and the hearing
of the same with love, will destroy the sins of the devotee and,
therefore, this is the simple Sadhana for attaining salvation. The
Sadhana for Krita Age was Sama-dama (tranquility of mind and body);
for Treta Age, sacrifice; for Dwapar worship; and for Kali (present) Age,
it is singing of the name and glory of the Lord. This last Sadhana is
open to all the people of the four Varnas (Brahmins, etc.). The other
Sadhanas, viz. Yoga Tyaga (sacrifice), Dhyan (meditation) and Dhyandharana
(concentration) are very difficult to practice, but singing and
hearing the stories and the glory of the Lord (Sai Baba) is very easy. We
have only to turn our attention towards them. The listening to and
singing of the stories will remove the attachment to the senses and their
objects, and will make the devotees dispassionate, and will ultimately
lead them to self-realization. With this end in view, Sai Baba made me
write His stories, as Satcharita. The devotees may now easily read and
hear these stories of Sai Baba and while doing so, meditate on Him, His
form and thus, attain devotion to Guru and God (Sai Baba), get dispassion
and self-realization. In the preparation and writing of this work,
Satcharita, it is Sai Baba’s grace, which has accomplished everything,
making use of me as a mere instrument.",
3,4,Motherly Love of Sai Baba,"Everybody knows, how a cow loves her infant calf. Her udder is
always full and when the calf wants milk and dashes at the udder, out
comes the milk in an unceasing flow. Similarly, a human mother knows
the wants of her child before-hand and feeds him, at her breast in time.
In case of dressing and adorning the child, the mother takes particular
care to see that, this is well done. The child knows or cares nothing
about this, but the mother’s joy knows no bounds, when she sees her
child well dressed and adorned. The love of the mother is peculiar,
extraordinary and disinterested, and has no parallel. Sadgurus feel this
motherly love towards their disciples. Sai Baba had the same love
towards me, and I give an instance of it below :
In 1916 I retired from Government service. The pension, that was
settled in my case, was not sufficient to maintain my family decently.
On Guru Pournima (15th of Ashadha) day of that year, I went to Shirdi
with other devotees. There, Mr. Anna Chinchanikar, of his own accord,
prayed to Baba for me as follows : “Please, look kindly at him, the
pension he gets is quite insufficient, his family is growing. Give him
some other appointment, remove his anxiety and make him happy!”
Baba replied, “He will get some other job, but now, he should serve Me
and be happy! His plates will be ever full and never empty. He should
turn all his attention towards Me and avoid the company of atheists,
irreligious and wicked people. He should be modest and humble
towards all, and worship Me with heart and soul. If he does this, he
will get eternal happiness.”
The question, who is this He, Whose worship is advocated, is
already answered in a note on “Who is Sai Baba” in the prologue, at
the beginning of this work.",
3,5,Rohilla's Story,"The story of the Rohila illustrates Sai Baba’s all embracing love.
One Rohila, tall and well-built, strong as a bull, came to Shirdi, wearing
a long Kafni (robe) and was enamored of the Sai, Who stayed there. Day
and night, he used to recite, in a loud and harsh tone the Kalma (verses
from Holy Quran) and shout “ALLAH HO AKBAR” (God is Great).
Most people of Shirdi, were working in their fields during the day and
when they returned to their homes at night, they were welcomed with
Rohila’s harsh cries and shouts. They could get no sleep and felt much
trouble and inconvenience. They suffered this nuisance for some days
in silence, and when they could stand it no longer, they approached
Baba and requested Him to check the Rohila and stop the nuisance.
Baba did not attend to their complaint. On the contrary, Baba took the
villagers to task and asked them to mind their own business. He said
to them that the Rohila had got a very bad wife, who tried to trouble
the Rohila and Himself; but hearing the Rohila’s prayers, she dare not
enter and they were at peace. In fact, the Rohila had no wife and by his
wife Baba meant Durbuddhi, i.e. evil thoughts. As Baba liked prayers
and cries to God better than anything else, He took the side of the
Rohila, and asked the villagers to wait and bear with the nuisance,
which would abate in due course.",
3,6,Baba's Sweet and Nectar-like Words,"One day at noon, after Arati, devotees were returning to their
lodgings, when Baba gave the following beautiful advice :
“Be wherever you like, do whatever you choose, remember this
well that, all what you do is known to Me. I am the Inner Ruler of all
and seated in your hearts. I envelope all the creatures, the movable
and immovable world. I am the Controller – the Wire-puller of the
show of this universe. I am the Mother – origin of all beings – the
Harmony of three Gunas, the Propeller of all senses, the Creator, Preserver
and Destroyer. Nothing will harm him, who turns his attention towards
Me, but Maya will lash or whip him, who forgets Me. All the insects,
ants, the visible, movable and immovable world, is My body or form”.
Hearing these beautiful and precious words, I, at once, decided in
my mind to serve no man henceforth but my Guru only; but the reply
of Baba to Anna Chinchanikar’s query (which was really mine) that I
would get some job, began to revolve in my mind, and I began to think,
whether it would come to happen. As future events showed, Baba’s
words came true and I got a Government job, but that was of short
duration. Then, I became free and devoted myself solely to the service
of my Guru Sai Baba.
Before concluding this chapter, I request the readers to leave out
the various hindrances, viz., indolence, sleep, wandering of mind,
attachments to senses etc. and turn their whole and undivided attention
to these stories of Sai Baba. Let their love be natural, let them know the
secret of devotion, let them not exhaust themselves by other Sadhanas,
let them stick to this simple remedy i.e. listening to Sai Baba’s stories.
This will destroy their ignorance and will secure for them salvation. A
miser may stay at various places, but he constantly thinks of his buried
treasure. So, let Sai Baba be enthroned in the hearts of all.
In the next chapter, I shall speak of Sai Baba’s advent in Shirdi.
Bow to Shri Sai – Peace be to all\",
4,1,Introduction,"In the last chapter, I described the circumstances, which led me to
write Sai Satcharita. Let me now describe the first advent of Sai Baba in
Shirdi.",
4,2,Mission of the Saints,"Lord Krishna says in Bhagvad Gita (Chapter IV, 7-8) that,
“Whenever there is a decay of Dharma (righteousness) and an
ascendancy of unrighteousness, I manifest Myself, for the protection of
the virtuous and the destruction of the vicious; and for the establishment
of righteousness, I manifest Myself Age after Age.”
This is the mission of to Lord, and the sages and saints, who are
His representatives, and who appear at appropriate times and work in
their own way to fulfil that mission. For instance, when the twice-born,
i.e. the Brahmins, the Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas neglect their duties,
and when the Shudras try to usurp the duties of other classes, when
spiritual preceptors are not respected but humiliated, when nobody cares
for religious instructions, when everybody thinks himself very learned,
when people begin to partake of forbidden foods and intoxicating drinks,
when under the cloak of religion people indulge in malpractices, when
people belonging to different sects fight amongst themselves, when
Brahmins fail to do Sandhya adoration, and the orthodox leave their
religious practices, when Yogis neglect their meditation, when people
begin to think that, wealth, progeny, wife are their sole concern; and thus,
turn away from the true path of salvation then, saints appear and try to
set matters right by their words and action. They serve us as beaconlights,
and show us the path, and the right way for us to follow. In this
way, many saints viz., Nivrutti, Dnyandev, Muktabai, Namdev, Gora,
Gonayi, Eknath, Tukaram, Narahari, Narsi Bhai, Sajan Kasai, Sawata,
Ramdas and various others did appear at various times to show the right
path to the people, and so, the present advent came as Shri Sai Baba of
Shirdi.",
4,3,Shirdi - a Holy Tirth,"The banks of the Godavari river, in the Ahmednagar district, are
very fortunate for they gave birth and refuge to many a saint, prominent
amongst them being Dnyaneshwar. Shirdi also falls in the Kopargaon
Taluka or the Ahmednagar district. After crossing the Godavari river at
Kopargaon, one gets on way to Shirdi. When you go three Kos1 (9 miles),
you come to Nimgaon, from where, Shirdi is visible. Shirdi is, as famous
and well-known as other holy places, like Gangapur, Nrisinhawadi,
Audumbar, on the banks of Krishna river. As the devotee Damoji
flourished, and blessed Mangalvedha (near Pandharpur), as Samarth
Ramdas at Sajjangad, as Shri Nrisimha Saraswati at Saraswatiwadi, so,
Sainath flourished at Shirdi and blessed it.",
4,4,Personality of Sai Baba,"It is on account of Shri Sai Baba that Shirdi grew into importance.
Let us see, what sort of a personage Sai Baba was. He conquered this
Sansar (worldly existence), which is very difficult and hard to cross.
Peace or mental calm was His ornament, and He was the repository of
wisdom. He was the home of Vaishnav devotees, most generous (like
Karna) amongst all, the quint-essence of all essences. He had no love for
perishable things, and was always engrossed in self-realization, which
was His sole concern. He felt no pleasure in the things of this world or
of the world beyond. His Antarang (heart) was as clear as a mirror, and
His speech always rained nectar. The rich or poor people were the same
to Him. He neither knew nor cared for honour or dishonour. He was the
Lord of all beings. He spoke freely and mixed with all people, watched
the actings and dances of nautch-girls and heard gazal-songs. Still, He
swerved not an inch from samadhi (mental equilibrium). The name of
Allah was always on His lips. While the world awoke He slept, and
while the world slept He was vigilant. His inner self was as calm as the
deep sea, His Ashram could not be determined, nor His actions could
be definitely determined; and though He sat (lived) in one place, He
knew all the transactions of the world. His Darbar was imposing. He
told hundreds of stories daily, still He swerved not an inch from His
vow of silence. He always leaned against the wall in the Masjid or
walked morning, noon and evening towards Lendi (Nala) and Chavadi,
still He at all times abided in the Self. Though a Siddha, He acted like a
Sadhaka. He was meek, humble and egoless, and pleased all. Such was
Sai Baba, and as the soil of Shirdi was trodden by Sai Baba’s Feet, it
attained extraordinary importance. As Dnyaneshwar elevated Alandi,
Eknath did to Paithan, so Sai Baba raised Shirdi. Blessed are the grassleaves
and stones of Shirdi, for they could kiss the Holy Feet of Sai Baba,
and take his dust on their head. Shirdi became to us devotees, another
Pandharpur, Jagannath, Dwarka, Benaras (Kashi) and Rameshwar,
Badrikedar, Nasik, Tryambakeshwar, Ujjain and Maha Kaleshwar or
Mahabaleshwar Gokarn. Contact of Sai Baba in Shirdi was like our study
of Veda and Tantra; it quietened our Sansar (world consciousness) and
rendered self-realization. The darshan of Shri Sai was our Yoga-sadhana,
and talk with Him removed our sins. Shampooing His Legs was our
bath in Triveni Prayag, and drinking the holy water of His Feet destroyed
our sins. To us, His commands were Vedas, and accepting (eating) His
Udi (sacred ashes) and Prasad was all purifying. He was our Shri
Krishna and Shri Ram, Who gave us solace, and He was our Para
Brahma (Absolute Reality). He was Himself beyond the pair of
Dwandwas (opposites), never dejected nor elated. He was always
engrossed in His Self as ‘Existence, Knowledge and Bliss.’ Shirdi was
His centre, but His field of action extended far beyond, to Punjab,
Calcutta, North India, Gujarat, Dacca (now in Bangladesh) and Konkan.
Thus, the fame of Sai Baba spread, far and wide, and people from all
parts came to take His darshan and be blessed. By mere darshan, minds
of people, whether pure or impure, would become quiet at once. They
got here the same unparalleled joy that, devotees get at Pandharpur by
seeing Vitthal Rakhumai. This is not an exaggeration. Consider, what a
devotee says in this respect.",
4,5,Dictum of Goulibua,"An old devotee, by name Goulibua, aged about 95 years, was a
Varkari of Pandhari. He stayed for 8 months at Pandharpur and for four
months – Ashadha to Kartik (July – November) on the banks of the
Ganges. He had a donkey with him for carrying his luggage, and a
disciple as his companion. Every year he made his Vari or trip to
Pandharpur and came to Shirdi to see Sai baba, Whom he loved most.
He used to gaze at Baba saying, “This is Pandharinath Vitthal incarnate,
the merciful Lord of the poor and helpless.” This Goulibua was an old
devotee of Vitthoba, and had made many a trip to Pandhari; and he
testified that Sai Baba was real Pandharinath.",
4,6,Vitthal Himself Appeared,"Sai Baba was very fond of remembering and singing God’s name.
He always uttered “Allah Malik” (God is Lord), and in His presence
made others sing God’s name continuously, day and night, for all 7
days of the week. This is called ‘Naamsaptah’. Once He asked Das Ganu
Maharaj to do the Naamsaptah. He replied that he would do it, provided
he was assured that, Vitthal would appear at the end of the 7th day.
Then, Baba placing His hand on His chest assured him that, certainly
Vitthal would appear, but for that the devotee must be ‘earnest and
devout’. The Dankapuri (Takore) of Dakurnath, the Pandhari of Vitthal,
the Dwarka of Ranchhod (Krishna) is here (Shirdi). One need not go far
out to see Dwarka. Will Vitthal come here from some outside place? He
is here! Only when the devotee is bursting with love and devotion,
Vitthal will manifest Himself here (Shirdi).*
After the Saptah was over, Vitthal did manifest Himself in the
following manner. Kakasaheb Dixit was, as usual, sitting in meditation
after his bath. He saw Vitthal in a vision. When he went at noon for
Baba’s darshan, Baba asked him point-blank, “Did Vitthal Patil come?
Did you see Him? He is a very truant fellow, catch Him firmly,
otherwise, He will escape if you are even a little inattentive”. This
happened in the morning and at noon there was another Vitthal
darshan. A hawker came there for selling 25 or 30 pictures of Vithoba.
This picture exactly tallied with the figure that had appeared in
Kakasaheb’s vision. On seeing this and remembering Baba’s words,
Kakasaheb Dixit was much surprised and delighted. He bought one
picture of Vithoba, and placed it in his shrine for worship.",
4,7,Bhagwantrao Kshirsagar's Story,"How fond was Baba for Vitthal worship was illustrated in
Bhagwantrao Kshirsagar’s story. The father of Bhagwantrao was a
devotee of Vithoba, and used to make Varis (annual trips) to
Pandharpur. He also had an image of Vithoba at home, which he
worshipped. After his death, the son stopped everything – the Vari, the
worship and Shraddha ceremony etc. When Bhagwantrao came to
Shirdi, Baba on remembering his father, at once said, “His father was
my friend, so I dragged him (the son) here. He never offered Naivaidya
(offering of food) and so, he starved Vitthal and Me. So, I brought him
here. I shall remonstrate him now and set him to worship.”",
4,8,Das Ganu's Bath in Prayag,"The Hindus think that, a bath in the holy Tirth of Prayag1, where
the Ganga and Yamuna meet, is very meritorious and thousands of
pilgrims go there periodically, to have the sacred bath there. Once, Das
Ganu thought that, he should go to Prayag for a bath and came to Baba
to get His permission for doing so. Baba replied to him, “It is not
necessary to go so far. Our Prayag is here, believe Me!” Then, wonder
of wonders! When Das Ganu placed his head on Baba’s Feet, out flowed
streams of Ganga-Yamuna water from both the toes of Baba. Seeing this
miracle, Das Ganu was overwhelmed with feelings of love and adoration,
and tears filled my eyes. Inwardly he felt inspired, and his speech burst
forth into a song in praise of Baba and His Leelas.",
4,9,Immaculate Conception of Sai Baba and His First Advent in Shirdi,"Nobody knew the parents, birth or birth-place of Sai Baba. Many
enquiries were made, many questions were put to Baba and others,
regarding these, but no satisfactory answer or information has yet been
obtained. Practically, we know nothing about these matters. Namdev and
Kabir were not born like ordinary mortals. They were found as infants in
mother-of-pearls; Namdev being found on the bank Bhimrathi river by
Gonayi, and Kabir on the bank Bhagirathi river by Tamal. Similar was the
case with Sai Baba. He first manifested Himself as a young lad of sixteen
years under a Neem tree in Shirdi, for the sake of Bhaktas. Even then, He
seemed to be full of the knowledge of Brahma. He had no desire for worldly
objects even in dreams. He kicked out Maya, and Mukti (deliverance) was
serving at His feet. One old woman of Shirdi, the mother of Nana Chopdar,
described Him thus; this young lad, fair, smart and very handsome, was
first seen under the Neem tree, seated in an Asan. The people of the village
were wonder-struck to see such a young lad practising hard penance, not
minding heat and cold. By day he associated with none, by night he was
afraid of nobody. People were wondering and asking, whence this young
chap had turned up. His form and features were so beautiful that a mere
look endeared Him to all. He went to nobody’s door, always sat near the
Neem tree. Outwardly, he looked very young, but by His action He was
really a Great Soul. He was the embodiment of dispassion and was an
enigma to all. One day, it so happened that God Khandoba possessed the
body of some devotee and people began to ask him, “Deva (God), You please
enquire, what blessed father’s son is this lad and whence did He come.”
God Khandoba asked them to bring a pick-axe and dig in a particuar place.
When it was dug, bricks were found underneath a flat stone. When the
stone was removed, a corridor was seen, in which four Samayis (lights)
were burning. The corridor led to a cellar, where cow-mouth-shaped
structures, wooden boards, rosaries were seen. Khandoba said, “This lad
practised penance here for 12 years.” Then, the people began to question
the lad about this. He put them off by telling them that, this was His Guru’s
place, His holy Watan, and requested them to guard this well. The people
then closed the corridor as before. As Ashwattha and Audumbar trees are
held sacred, Baba regarded this Neem tree equally sacred, and loved it most.
Mhalsapati and other Shirdi devotees regard this site as the resting place
(Samadhi-sthan) of Baba’s Guru and prostrate before it.
",
4,10,Three Wadas,"(1) The site with the Neem tree and surrounding space was bought
by Mr. Hari Vinayak Sathe, and on this site a big building styled Sathe’s
Wada was erected. This Wada was the sole resting place for pilgrims,
who flocked there. A platform was built round the Neem tree and lofts
with steps were constructed. Under the steps, there is a niche facing south
and devotees sit on the Par (platform) facing north. It is believed that,
he, who burns incense there on Thursday and Friday evenings, will by
God’s grace, be happy. This Wada was old and dilapidated and needed
repairs. The necessary repairs, additions and alterations have been made
now by the Sansthan. (2) Then, after some years, another Wada, Dixit’s
Wada was constructed. Kakasaheb Dixit, Solicitor of Mumbai, had gone
to England. He had injured his leg in an accident there. The injury could
not be got rid of by any means. Nanasaheb Chandorkar advised him to
see Sai Baba. So, he went to Sai Baba in 1909, and requested Him to cure
the lameness of his mind rather than that of his leg. He was so much
pleased with the darshan of Sai Baba, that he decided to reside in Shirdi.
So, he built a Wada for himself and other devotees. The foundation of
this building was laid on 10-12-1910. On this day, two other important
events took place. (1) Mr. Dadasaheb Khaparde was given permission
to return home, and (2) The night Arati at the chavadi was started. The
Wada was completed and was inhabited on the Ram Navami day in
1911, with due rites and formalities. (3) Then, another Wada or palatial
mansion was put up by the famous millionaire, Mr. Buti, of Nagpur. A
lot of money was spent on this building, but it was all well utilized, as
Sai Baba’s Body is resting in this Wada, which is now called the
‘Samadhi Mandir’. The site of this Mandir formerly had a garden, which
was watered and looked after by Baba. Three Wadas thus came up,
where there was none formerly. Of these Sathe’s Wada was most useful
to all, in the early days.
The story of the garden which was attended by Sai Baba with the
help of Vaman Tatya, the temporary absence of Sai Baba from Shirdi,
and His coming again to Shirdi with the marriage-party of Chand Patil,
the company of Devidas, Jankidas and Gangagir, Baba’s wrestling
match with Mohiddin Tamboli, residing in the Masjid, love of Mr. Dengle
and other devotees; and other incidents will be described in the next
chapter.
Bow to Shri Sai – Peace be to all",
5,1,Return With Chand Patil's Marriage-party,"As hinted in the last chapter, I shall now describe first, how Sai
Baba returned to Shirdi after His disappearance.
There lived in the Aurangabad district (Nizam state), in a village
called ‘Dhoop’, a well-to-do Mohammeden gentlman by name Chand
Patil. While He was making a trip to Aurangabad, he lost his mare. For
two long months, he made a diligent search, but could get no trace of
the lost mare. After being disappointed, he returned from Aurangabad
with the saddle on his back. After travelling four Kos and a half, he
came on the way, to a mango tree at the foot of which sat a fakir (queer
fellow). He had a cap on His head, wore Kafni (long robe) and had a
Satka (short stick) under His arm, and He was preparing to smoke a
Chillim (pipe). On seeing Chand Patil pass by, He called out to him and
asked him to have a smoke and to rest a little. The queer fellow or Fakir
asked him about the saddle. Chand Patil replied that, it was of his mare,
which was lost sometime back. The Fakir asked him to make a search
in the Nala close by. He went and the wonder of wonders! He found
the mare there. He thought that this Fakir was not an ordinary man, but
an Avalia (a great saint). He returned to the Fakir with the mare. The
Chillim was ready for being smoked, but two things were wanting : (1)
fire to light the pipe, and (2) water to wet the Chhapi (piece of cloth,
through which smoke is drawn up). The Fakir took His prong and
thrust it forcibly into the ground and out came a live ember, which He
put on the pipe. Then, He dashed the Satka on the ground, from where
water began to ooze. The Chhapi was wetted with that water, then
wrung out and wrapped round the pipe. Thus, everything being
complete, the Fakir smoked the Chillim and then, gave it also to Chand
Patil. On seeing all this, Chand Patil was wonder-struck. He requested
the Fakir to come to his home and accept his hospitality. Next day, He
went to Patil’s house and stayed there for some time. Patil was a villageofficer
of Dhoop. His wife’s brother’s son was to be married and the
bride was from Shirdi. So, Patil made preparations to start for Shirdi for
the marriage. The Fakir also accompanied the marriage-party. The
marriage went off without any hitch, the party returned to Dhoop,
except the Fakir who stayed back in Shirdi, and remained there forever.",
5,2,How the Fakir Got the Name 'Sai',"When the marriage-party came to Shirdi, it alighted at the foot of
a Banyan tree in Bhagat Mhalsapati’s field, near Khandoba’s temple.
The carts were loosened in the open courtyard of Khandoba’s temple,
and the members of the party descended one by one, and the Fakir also
got down. Bhagat Mhalsapati saw the young Fakir getting down and
accosted Him “YA SAI” (Welcome Sai)! Others also addressed Him as
“Sai” and thenceforth, He became ‘Sai Baba’.",
5,3,Contact With Other Saints,"Sai Baba began to stay in a deserted Masjid. One saint, named
Devidas had been living in Shirdi, for many years before Baba came
there. Baba liked his company. He stayed with him in the Maruti
temple, in the Chavadi, and for some time lived alone. Then, came
another saint by name Jankidas. Baba spent most of His time in talking
with him, or Jankidas went to Baba’s residence. So also, one Vaishya
house-holder saint, from Puntambe by name Gangagir, always
frequented Shirdi. When he first saw Sai Baba, carrying pitchers of
water in both hands, for watering the garden, he was amazed and said
openly, “Blessed is Shirdi, that, it got this Precious Jewel. This man is
carrying water to-day; but He is not an ordinary fellow. As this land
(Shirdi) was fortunate and meritorious, it secured this Jewel.” So also,
one famous saint by name Anandnath of Yewala Math2, a disciple of
Akkalkot Maharaj, came to Shirdi with some people when he saw Sai
Baba, he said openly, “This is a Precious Diamond in reality. Though
He looks like an ordinary man, He is not a ‘Gar’ (ordinary stone), but
a Diamond. You will realize this in the near future.” Saying this he
returned to Yewala. This was said, while Sai Baba was a youngster.",
5,4,Baba's Dress and Daily Routine,"In His young days, Sai Baba grew the hair on His head, never had
His head shaved. He dressed like an athlete. When He went to Rahata
(3 miles from Shirdi), He brought with Him small plants of Merrigold,
Jai and Jui, and after cleaning them He planted and watered them. A
devotee, by name Vaman Tatya, supplied Him daily with two unbaked
earthen pitchers. With these Baba Himself used to water the plants. He
drew water from the well and carried the pitchers on His shoulders. In
the evening, the pitchers were kept at the foot of the Neem tree. As soon
as they were placed there, they broke as they were made of mud and
not baked. Next day, Tatya supplied two fresh pitchers. This course
went on for 3 years, and with Sai Baba’s toil and effort, there grew a
garden. On this site, at present, stands the big mansion – Samadhi
Mandir of Baba, which is now frequented by so many devotees.",
5,5,The Story of Padukas (foot-prints) under the Neem Tree,"A devotee of Akkalkot Maharaj, by name Bhai Krishnaji Alibagkar,
worshipped the photo of Akkalkot Maharaj. He once thought of going
to Akkalkot (Solapur district), take the darshan of the Padukas (footprints)
of the Maharaj and offer his sincere prayer there, but before he
could go there, he got a vision in his dream. Akkalkot Maharaj appeared
in the vision and said to him, “Now, Shirdi is my resting place, go there
and offer your worship!” So, Bhai changed his plan and came to Shirdi,
worshipped Baba, stayed there for six months and was happy. As a
reminiscence of this vision etc., he prepared the Padukas and installed
them on an auspicious day of Shravan, Shaka 1834 (1912 A.D.) under
the Neem tree with due ceremonies and formalities, conducted by Dada
Kelkar and Upasani. One Dixit Brahmin was appointed for worship,
and the management was entrusted to devotee Sagun.",
5,6,Complete Version of this Story,"Mr. B.V. Dev, retired Mamlatdar of Thana, and a great devotee of
Sai Baba, made enquiries about this matter with Sagun Meru Naik and
Govind Kamlakar Dixit and has published a full version of the Padukas
in Sai Leela, Vol. 11, No. I, page 25. It runs as follows :
In 1834 Shaka (1912 A.D.) one Doctor Ramrao Kothare of Mumbai
came to Shirdi for Baba’s darshan. His compounder and his friend,
Bhai Krishnaji Alibagkar, accompanied him. The compounder and Bhai
became intimate with Sagun Meru Naik and G.K. Dixit. While discussing
things, these persons thought that, there must be some memorial of Sai
Baba’s first advent at Shirdi and his sitting under the holy Neem tree.
They thought of installing Baba’s Padukas there, and were going to
make them of some rough stone. Then, Bhai’s friend, the compounder,
suggested that, if this matter was made known to his master, Dr. Ramrao
Kothare, he would prepare nice Padukas for this purpose. All liked this
proposal and Dr. Kothare was informed of it. He came to Shirdi and
drew a plan of the Padukas. He went to Upasani Maharaj in Khandoba’s
temple and showed him his plan. The latter made many improvements,
drew lotus, flowers, conch, disc, mace etc. and suggested that, the
following Shloka (verse), regarding Neem tree’s greatness and Baba’s
Yogic powers be inscribed. The verse was as follows :
“Sada Nimbavrikshasya mooladhiwasaat,
Sudhastravinam tiktamapiapriyam tam,
Tarum Kalpavrikshadhikam sadhayantam
Namameeshwaram Sadgurum Sai Natham”*
Upasani’s suggestions were accepted and carried out. The Padukas
were made in Mumbai and sent to Shirdi with the compounder. Baba
said that they should be installed on the Pournima (15th) of Shravan.
On that day at 11 a.m., G.K. Dixit brought them on his head from
Khandoba’s temple to the Dwarkamai (Masjid) in a procession. Baba
touched the Padukas, saying that, these are the Feet of the Lord, and
asked the people to install them at foot of the Neem tree.
A day earlier, one Parsi devotee of Mumbai, named Pastha Sheth,
sent Rs. 25/- by money order. Baba gave this sum for the installation
of the Padukas. The total expense of installation came up to Rs. 100/-,
out of which Rs. 75/- were collected by subscriptions. For the first 5
years, G.K. Dixit worshipped the Padukas daily and then, this was
done by Laxman Kacheshwar Jakhadi. In the first five years, Dr. Kothare
sent Rs. 2 per month for lighting the lamp and he also sent the railing
round the Padukas. The expense of bringing the railing from the station
to Shirdi (Rs. 7-8-0)1 (presently Rs. 7.50 p.) and roofing was paid by
Sagun Meru Naik. Now, Jakhadi (Nana Pujari) does the worship, and
Sagun Meru Naik offers the Naivaidya and lights the evening lamps.
Bhai Krishnaji was originally a devotee of Akkalkot Maharaj. He
had come to Shirdi at the installation of the Padukas, in Shaka 1834
on his way to Akkalkot. He wanted to go to Akkalkot, after taking the
darshan of Baba. He asked Baba’s permission for this. Baba said, “Oh,
what is there in Akkalkot? Why do you go there? The Maharaj of that
place is here, Myself.” Hearing this, Bhai did not go to Akkalkot. He
came to Shirdi off and on, after the installation of the Padukas.
Mr. B.V. Dev concluded that, Hemadpant did not know these
details. Had he known them, he would not have failed to depict them
in his Satcharita.",
5,7,Wrestling Bout with Mohiddin Tamboli and Change in Life style,"To return to other stories of Baba. There was a wrestler in Shirdi,
by name Mohiddin Tamboli. Baba and he did not agree on some
points, and both had a fight. In this Baba was defeated. Thenceforth,
Baba changed His dress and mode of living. He donned Kafni, wore
a Langot (waist band) and covered His head with a piece of cloth. He
took a piece of sack-cloth for His bed, and was content with wearing
torn and worn out rags. He always said that “Poverty is better than
kingship, far better than Lordship. The Lord is always brother
(befriender) of the poor.” Gangagir was also very fond of wrestling.
Once while he was wrestling, a similar feeling of dispassion descended
over him, and at the proper time he heard the voice of an adept saying
that he should wear out his body, playing with God. So, he too gave
up Sansara and turned towards God-realization. He established a
Math on the banks of the river, near Puntambe, and lived there with
his disciples.
Sai Baba did not mix and speak with the people. He only gave
answers, when he was questioned. By day he always sat under the Neem
tree, some times in the shade of a Babool tree, near the stream, on the
outskirts of the village. In the afternoon, He used to walk at random and
go at times to Nimgaon. There, He frequented the house of Balasaheb
Dengle. Baba loved Mr. Balasaheb. His younger brother, named Nanasaheb
had no son, though he married a second wife. Balasaheb sent Nanasaheb
for taking darshan of Sai Baba, and after some time with His grace
Nanasaheb got a son. From that time onwards, people began to come in
large numbers to see Sai Baba, and His fame began to spread and reached
Ahmednagar, from thence, Nanasaheb Chandorkar and Keshav
Chidamber, and many others began to come to Shirdi. Baba was
surrounded by His devotees during day, and slept at night in an old and
dilapidated Masjid. Baba’s paraphernalia at this time, consisted of a
Chillim, tobacco, a ‘Tumrel’ (tin pot), long Kafni, a piece of cloth round
His head, and a Satka (short stick), which He always kept with Him. The
piece of white cloth on the head was twisted like matted hair, and flowed
down from the left ear on the back. This was not washed for weeks. He
wore no shoes, no sandals. A piece of sack-cloth was His seat for most
of the day. He wore a coupin (waist-cloth-band) and for warding off cold,
he always sat in front of a Dhuni (sacred fire) facing south, with His left
hand resting on the wooden railing. In that Dhuni, He offered an oblation
of egoism, desires and always uttered “Allah Malik” (God is the sole
owner). The Masjid, in which He sat, was only of two room dimensions,
where all devotees came and saw Him. After 1912, there was a change.
The old Masjid was repaired and a pavement was constructed. Before
Baba came to live in this Masjid, He lived for a long time in a place Takia,
where with Ghungru (small bells) tied on His ankles, Baba danced
beautifully and sang with tender love.",
5,8,Turning Water into Oil,"Sai Baba was very fond of lights. He used to borrow oil from
shopkeepers, and keep lamps burning the whole night in the Masjid
and temple. This went on for some time. The Banias1, who supplied oil
gratis, once met together and decided not to give Him oil. When, as
usual, Baba went to ask for oil, they all gave Him a distinct “No”.
Unperturbed, Baba returned to the Masjid and kept the dry wicks in the
lamps. The Banias were watching Him with curiosity. Baba took the
Tumrel (tin pot), which contained very little (a few drops) oil, put water
into it and drank it, and then, forced it out to fall into the container.
After consecrating the tin-pot in this way, He again took the water from
the tin-pot and filled all the lamps with it and lighted them. To the
surprise and dismay of the watching Banias, the lamps began to burn
and kept burning the whole night. The Banias repented and apologized
and Baba forgave them, and asked them to be more truthful in future.",
5,9,The Pseudo Guru Javhar Ali,"Five years after the wrestling bout above-mentioned, one Fakir
from Ahmednagar, by name Javhar Ali, came to Rahata with his disciples
and stayed in Bakhal (spacious room) near Virabhadra temple. The
Fakir was learned, could repeat the whole Quran and had a sweet
tongue. Many religious and devout people of the village came to him
and began to respect him. With the help of the people, he started to
build an Idgah (a walled enclosure, in which Mohammedens pray on
Id day), near the Virabhadra temple. There was some quarrel about this
affair, on account of which Javhar Ali had to leave Rahata. Then, he
came to Shirdi and lived in the Masjid with Baba. People were captured
by his sweet talk, and he began to call Baba his disciple. Baba did not
object and consented to be his Chela (disciple). Then, both Guru and
Chela decided to return to Rahata and live there. The Guru (teacher)
never knew his Disciple’s worth, but the Disciple knew the shortcomings
of the Guru, still He never disrespected him, observing carefully his
duties. He even served the master in various ways. They used to come
to Shirdi off and on, but their main stay was in Rahata. The loving
devotees of Baba in Shirdi did not like that Baba should stay away from
them in Rahata. So they went in a deputation to bring Baba back to
Shirdi. When they met Baba near the Idgah and told the purpose for
which they came, Baba said to them that the Fakir was an angry, illtempered
fellow, he would not leave Him and that, they should better
go back to Shirdi without Him before the Fakir returned. While they
were thus talking, the Fakir turned up and was very angry with them
for trying to take away his Disciple. There was some hot discussion and
altercation, and it was finally decided that both the Guru and Chela
should return to Shirdi. And so, they returned and lived in Shirdi. But,
after a few days, the Guru was tested by Devidas and he was found
wanting. Twelve years before Baba arrived in Shirdi with the marriageparty,
this Devidas, aged about 10 or 11 years, came to Shirdi and lived
in the Maruti temple. Devidas had fine features and brilliant eyes, and
he was dispassion incarnate and a Dhyani1. Many people, namely
Tatya Kote, Kashinath and others regarded him as their Guru. They
brought Javhar Ali in his presence, and in the discussion that followed,
Javhar was worsted and fled from Shirdi. He went and stayed in
Bijapur and returned after many years to Shirdi, and prostrated himself
before Sai Baba. The delusion, that, he was Guru and Sai Baba, his
Chela, was cleared away and as he repented, Sai Baba treated him with
respect. In this case Sai Baba showed by His conduct, how one should
get rid of egoism and do the duties of a disciple to attain the highest
end, viz., self-realization. This story is told here according to the version
given by Mhalsapati (a great devotee of Baba).
In the next chapter Ram Navami Festival, the Masjid, its former
condition and later improvement in it etc. will be described.
Bow to Shri Sai – Peace be to all",
6,1,Ram Navami Festival and Masjid Repairs,"Before describing Ram Navami Festival and Masjid repairs, the
author makes some preliminary remarks about Sadguru as follows :",
6,2,Efficacy of the Touch of the Guru's Hand,,"When Sadguru is the helmsman he is sure to carry us safely and
easily beyond the worldly ocean. The word Sadguru brings to mind Sai
Baba, the Perfect Master. He appears to me, as if standing before me and
applying Udi (sacred ashes) to my forehead and placing his hand of
blessing on my head. Then joy fills my heart and love overflows my
eyes. Wonderful is the power of the touch of Guru’s hand. The subtlebody
(consisting of thoughts and desires) which cannot be burnt by the
gross fire, is destroyed by the mere touch of the Guru’s hand, and the
sins of many past births are cleaned and washed away. Even the
speech of those, who feel agitated, when they hear religious and Godly
talks, attain calmness. The sight of Sai Baba’s handsome form chokes
our throat with joy, makes the eyes overflow with tears and overwhelms
the heart with emotions. It awakens in us “I am He” (Soham) Brahma
consciousness, manifests the joy of self-realization and dissolving the
distinction of I and Thou, makes us one with the Supreme (One Reality).
When I begin to read scriptures, at every step I am reminded of my
Sadguru, Sai Baba, Who assumes the form of Rama or Krishna and
makes me listen to His Life. For instance, when I sit to listen to Bhagwat,
Sai becomes Krishna from top to toe, and I think He sings the Bhagwat
or Uddhav Gita (song of teachings by Lord Shri Krishna to His disciple,
Uddhav) for the welfare of the devotees. When I myself start to write
anything, I cannot compose a few words or sentences; but when He of
His own accord makes me write, I go on writing... and there is no end
to it. When the disciple’s egoism props up, He presses it down with His
hand and gives him His own power, makes him achieve His object and
thus, satisfies and blesses him. If any one prostrates before Sai and
surrenders his heart and soul to Him, then all the chief objects of life,
viz., Dharma (righteousness), Artha (wealth), Kama (Desire) and
Moksha (Deliverance), are attained easily and unsolicitedly. Four paths,
viz., of Karma, Dnyan, Yoga and Bhakti lead us separately to God. Of
these, the path of Bhakti is thorny and full of pits and ditches and thus,
difficult to traverse; but if you, relying on your Sadguru avoid the pits
and thorns and walk straight, it will take you to your destination (God),
so says Sai Baba.
After philosophising about the self-existent Brahma, His power
(Maya) to create this world and the world created, and stating that all
these three are ultimately one and the same, the author quotes Sai
Baba’s words guaranteeing the welfare of the Bhaktas :
“There will never be any dearth or scarcity, regarding food and
clothes in My devotee’s home. It is my special characteristic, that I
always look to and provide for, the welfare of those devotees, who
worship Me whole-heartedly with their minds ever fixed on Me. Lord
Krishna has also said the same in the Gita. Therefore strive not much
for food and clothes. If you want anything, beg of the Lord, renounce
worldly honours, try to get Lord’s grace and blessings and be honoured
in His court. Do not be deluded by worldly honour. The form of the
Deity should be firmly fixed in the mind. Let all the senses and mind
be ever devoted to the worship of the Lord, let there be no attraction for
any other thing. Fix the mind in remembering Me always, so that it will
not wander elsewhere, towards body, wealth and home. Then it will be
calm, peaceful and care-free. This is the sign of the mind being well
engaged in good company. If the mind is vagrant, it cannot be called
well-merged in Him.”
After quoting these words, the author goes on to relate the story
of Ram Navami festival in Shirdi. As Ram Navami is the most celebrated
festival at Shirdi, another fuller account, as published in Sri Sai Leela
Magazine of 1925, page 197, is also referred to and a summary of the
festival, as related in both these accounts is attempted here."
6,3,Origin of the Ram Navami Festival,"One Mr. Gopalrao Gund, was a surveyor in Survey dept. at
Kopergaon. He was a great devotee of Baba. He had three wives but had
no issue. With Sai Baba’s blessings, a son was born to him. In the joy
that he felt due to this, an idea of celebrating a fair or ‘Urus’1 occurred
to him in the year 1897, and he placed it for consideration before other
Shirdi devotees, viz. Tatya Patil, Dada Kote Patil and Madhavrao
Deshpande (Shama). They all approved of the idea, and obtained Sai
Baba’s permission and blessings for it. Then an application was made
to get the Collector’s2 sanction for celebrating the Urus, but as the
village Kulkarni held against holding the fair the sanction was refused.
But, as Sai Baba had blessed it, they tried again and ultimately succeeded
in getting the Collector’s sanction. The day for the Urus was fixed on
Ram Navami, after having consultation with Sai Baba. It seems He had
some purpose behind this, viz. the unification of the two festivals, the
Urus and the Ram Navami and the unification of the two communities
– the Hindus and the Mohammedens. As future events showed, this
end or object was duly achieved.
Though the permission was obtained, but other difficulties cropped
up. Shirdi was a village and there was scarcity of water. There were two
wells in the village, the one in use dried up soon and the water from
the second was brackish. This brackish water was turned into sweet
water by Sai Baba, by putting flowers into it. As the water of this well
was insufficient, so Tatya Patil had to arrange to get water from outside.
Temporary shops were to be constructed and wrestling bouts arranged.
Gopalrao Gund had a friend by name Damu Anna Kasar of Ahmednagar.
He also was similarly unhappy in the matter of progeny, though he had
two wives. He too was blessed by Sai Baba with sons and Mr. Gund
prevailed upon his friend to prepare and supply one flag for the
procession of the fair. He also succeeded in inducing Mr. Nanasaheb
Nimonkar to supply another flag. Both these flags were taken in
procession through the village and finally, fixed at the two corners of
the Masjid, which is called by Sai Baba as ‘Dwarkamai’. This is being
done even now.",
6,4,The 'Sandal' Procession,"There was another procession which was started in this fair. The
idea of ‘Sandal’ procession originated with one Mr. Amir Shakkar
Dalal, a Mohammeden Bhakta from Korhla. This procession is held in
honour of great Muslim Saints. Sandal i.e. Chandan paste and scrappings
are put in the Thali (flat dishes) with incense burning before them and
carried in procession to the accompaniment of band and music through
the village and then, after returning to the Masjid, the contents of the
dishes are thrown on the ‘Nimbar’ (niche) and walls of the Masjid. This
work was managed by Mr. Amir Shakkar for the first three years and
then afterwards, by his wife. So, on the same day the two processions,
the ‘Flags’ by the Hindus and ‘Sandal’ by the Muslims, went on side
by side and are still going on without any problem.",
6,5,Arrangement of the Ram Navami Festival,"This day was very dear and sacred to the devotees of Sai Baba.
Most of them turned up for the occasion and took part in the management
of the fair. Tatya Kote Patil looked to all outward affairs, while the
internal management was entirely left to Radhakrishnamai, a female
devotee of Baba. Her residence was full of guests on the occasion, and
she had to look after their needs, and also arrange for all the
paraphernalia of the fair. Another work, which she willingly did, was
to clean and white-wash the entire Masjid, its walls and floor, which
were blackened and were full of soot on account of the perpetual Dhuni
(sacred fire) of Sai Baba. This she did during the night, when Sai Baba
had gone to sleep every alternate night in the Chavadi. She had to take
out all the things, including the Dhuni, and after thorough cleaning
and white-washing replace them, as they were before. Feeding the poor,
which was so dear to Sai Baba, was also a important item in this fair.
For this purpose, cooking on a grand scale and preparing various sweet
dishes, was done in Radhakrishnamai’s lodging, and various rich and
wealthy devotees took a leading part in this.",
6,6,Transformation of Urus into Ram Navami Festival,"Things were going on in this way and the fair was gradually
increasing in importance till 1912, when a change took place. That year
one devotee, Mr. Krishnarao Jogeshwar Bhishm (the author of ‘Sai
Sagunopasana’), came for the fair with Dadasaheb Khaparde of
Amaravati and was staying (on the previous day) in the Dixit Wada.
While he was lying in the verandah, and while Mr. Laxmanrao alias
Kaka Mahajani was going with Puja materials to the Masjid, a thought
arose in his mind and he accosted the latter thus – There is some
providential arrangement in the fact that the Urus or fair is celebrated
in Shirdi on Ram Navami; Ram Navami is very dear to all the Hindus,
then why not begin the Ram Navami festival – the celebration of the
birth of Shri Ram on this day here? Kaka Mahajani liked the idea, and
it was arranged to get Baba’s permission in this matter. The main
difficulty was how to secure a Haridas who would do ‘Kirtan’ and sing
the glories of the Lord on the occasion. But, Bhishm solved the difficulty
by saying that his ‘Ram Akhyan’, the composition on Rama’s birth was
ready and he would do the ‘Kirtan’ himself, while Kaka Mahajani
should play on the harmonium. It was also arranged to get the
‘Sunthavada’ (ginger-powder mixed with sugar) as Prasad, prepared
by Radhakrishnamai. So they immediately went to the Masjid to get
Baba’s permission. Baba Who knew everything and aware of what was
happening there, asked Mahajani, as to what was going on in the
Wada. Being rather perturbed Mahajani could not catch the purport of
the question and remained silent. Then Baba asked Bhishm what he
had to say. He explained the idea of celebrating Ram Navami festival
and asked for Baba’s permission and Baba gladly gave it. All rejoiced
and made preparations for the Jayanti1-festival. Next day the Masjid
was decorated with buntings etc., a cradle was supplied by
Radhakrishnamai and placed in front of Baba’s seat and the proceedings
started. Bhishm stood up for Kirtan and Mahajani began to play on the
harmonium. Sai Baba sent a man to call Mahajani. He was hesitating
to go, doubtful whether Baba would allow the festival to go on but
when he went to Baba, the latter asked him as to what was going on
and why the cradle was placed there. He asnwered that the Ram
Navami festival had commenced and the cradle was put out for that
purpose. Then Baba took a garland from the ‘Nimbar’ (niche) and
placed it round his neck and sent another garland for Bhishm. Then the
Kirtan commenced. When it came to a close, loud sounds of “Victory
to Ram” went up and Gulal (colour-powder) was thrown up all around,
amidst band and music. Everybody was overjoyed, when suddenly a
roar was heard. The red-powder thrown promiscuously, went up and
somehow fell into Baba’s eyes. Baba got wild and began to scold and
abuse loudly. People got frightened and took to their heels. The intimate
devotees who knew Baba well, took these scoldings and outpourings of
Baba, as blessings in disguise. They thought that when Ram was born,
it was proper for Baba to get wild and enraged to kill Ravan and his
demons, in the form of egoism and wicked thoughts etc. Besides they
knew that, whenever a new thing was undertaken at Shirdi, it was
usual with Baba to get wild and angry and so they kept quiet.
Radhakrishnamai was rather afraid and thought that Baba might break
her cradle and she asked Mahajani to pull the cradle back. When he
went to loosen and unfasten the cradle, Baba went to him and asked
him not to remove it. Then after some time Baba became calm and that
day’s programme, including Mahapuja and Arati was finished. Later
on Mr. Mahajani asked Baba for permission to remove the cradle, Baba
refused the same saying that, the festival was not yet over. Next day
another ‘Kirtan’ and Gopal-kala ceremony [an earthern pot containing
parched rice mixed with curd is hung, to be broken after the ‘Kirtan’,
and the contents distributed to all, as was done by Lord Krishna
amongst His cow-herd (friends)], was performed and then, Baba allowed
the cradle to be removed. While the Ram Navami festival was thus
going on, the procession of the two flags by day and that of the ‘Sandal’
by night, went off with the usual pomp and show. From this time
onwards, the ‘Urus of Baba’ was transformed into the Ram Navami
festival.
From next year (1913), the items in the programme of Ram Navami
began to increase. Radhakrishnamai started a ‘Naam-saptah’ (singing
the glory of God’s name continuously day and night for seven days),
from (eleventh) day of Chaitra. For this all devotees took part by turns
and she also joined it sometimes early in the morning. As Ram Navami
festival is celebrated in many places all over the country, the difficulty
of getting a Haridas was felt again. But 5 or 6 days before the festival,
Mahajani incidentally met Balabua who was known as modern Tukaram
and got him to do the ‘Kirtan’ that year. The next year (1914), another
Balabua Satarkar of Birhad Siddha-kavathe, district Satara, could not
act as a Haridas in his own town, as plague was prevailing there and
so he came to Shirdi. With Baba’s permission, which was secured
through Kakasaheb Dixit, he did the Kirtan and was sufficiently
recompensed for his labour. The difficulty of getting a new Haridas
every year was finally solved from 1914 by Sai Baba, as He entrusted
this function to Das Ganu Maharaj permanently and since that time he
has been successfully and creditably conducting that function until
now.
Since 1912, this festival began to grow gradually year by year.
From the 8th to 12th of Chaitra, Shirdi looked like a bee-hive of men.
Shops began to increase. Celebrated wrestlers took part in wrestling
bouts. Feeding of the poor was done on a grander scale. Hard work and
sincere efforts of Radhakrishnamai turned Shirdi into a Sansthan. (State)
Paraphernalia increased. A beautiful horse, a palanquin, chariot and
many silver items, utensils, pots, buckets, pictures, mirrors etc. were
presented. Elephants were also sent for the procession. Though, all this
paraphernalia increased enormously, Sai Baba ignored all these things
and maintained His simplicity and modesty as before. It is to be noted
that both the Hindus and Mohammedens have been working in unison,
in both the processions during the entire festival, and there has been no
confrontation or quarrel between them at all so far. First about 5000-
7000 people used to gather, but that figure went up to 75,000 in some
years, still, there was no outbreak of any epidemic disease nor any riots
worth the name during past so many years.",
6,7,Repairs to the Masjid,"Another important idea occurred to Gopal Gund. Just as he started
the Urus or fair, he thought that he should repair and renovate the
Masjid. So in order to carry out the repairs, he collected stones and got
them dressed. But this work was not assigned to him. This was reserved
for Nanasaheb Chandorkar and the pavement-work for Kakasaheb Dixit.
Initially Baba was unwilling to allow them to have work done, but with
the intervention of Mhalsapati, a local devotee of Baba, His permission
was secured. Baba took a small Gadi for His seat, discarding the usual
piece of sack-cloth, used till then. In 1911, the Sabha Mandap (courtyard)
was also put in order with great labour and effort. The open space
in front of the Masjid was very small and inconvenient. Kakasaheb
Dixit wanted to extend it and put a roofing on it. At great expense, he
got iron-posts, pillars and trusses and started the work. At night all the
devotees worked hard and fixed the posts; but Baba when he returned
from Chavadi next morning, uprooted them all and threw them out.
Once it so happened that Baba got very excited, caught a pole with one
hand and began to shake and uproot it and with the other hand caught
Tatya Patil's neck. He took by force Tatya’s Pheta, struck a match, set
it on fire and threw it, in a pit. At that time, Baba’s eyes flashed like
burning embers. None dared to look at Him. All got terribly frightened.
Baba took out a rupee from his pocket and threw it there, as if it were
an offering on an auspicious occasion. Tatya was also much frightened.
None knew, what was going to happen to Tatya and none dared to
interfere. Bhagoji Shinde, the leper devotee of Baba, made a bold advance,
but he was pushed aside by Baba. Madhavrao was also similarly
treated, pelted with brick-pieces. So all those who went to intercede
were similarly dealt with. But, after some time, Baba’s anger cooled
down. He sent for a shop-keeper, got from him an embroidered Pheta
and Himself tied it on Tatya’s head, as if he was being given a special
honour. All the people were wonderstruck to see this strange behaviour
of Baba. They were at a loss to know, what enraged Baba so suddenly
and what led Him to assault Tatya Patil, and why His anger cooled
down the next moment. Baba was sometimes very calm and quiet and
talked sweet things with love, but suddenly, with or without any reason,
got enraged. Many such incidents may be related; but I do not know
which to choose and which to omit. I therefore, refer them as they occur
to me.
In the next chapter the question, whether Baba was a Hindu or a
Mohammeden will be taken up and His Yogic practices and powers
and other matters will also be dealt with.
Bow to Shri Sai Baba – Peace be to all",
7,1,Wonderful Incarnation,"Sai Baba knew all Yogic practices. He was well-versed in the six
processes including Dhauti (stomach-cleaning, by a moistened piece of
linen 3' in breadth and 22½' in length), Khandayog, i.e. separating His
limbs and joining them again and Samadhi etc. If you thought that He
was a Hindu, He looked like a Yavan. If you thought Him to be a
Yavan, He looked like a pious Hindu. No one definitely knew whether
He was a Hindu or a Mohammeden. He celebrated the Hindu festival
of Ram Navami with all due formalities, and at the same time permitted
the ‘Sandal’ procession of the Mohammedens. He encouraged wrestling
bouts in this festival. When the Gokul Ashtami came, He got the ‘Gopalkala’
ceremony duly performed, and on Id festivals, He allowed the
Mohammedens, to say their prayers (Namaz) in His Masjid. Once,
during a Moharrum festival, some Mohammedens proposed to construct
a Taziya or Tabut in the Masjid, keep it there for some days and
afterwards take it in procession through village. Sai Baba allowed the
keeping of the Tabut for four days and on the fifth day got it removed
from the Masjid, without the least compunction. If we say that He was
a Mohammeden, His ears were pierced (i.e. had holes, according to
Hindu custom). If you think that He was a Hindu, He advocated the
practice of circumcision (though, according to Mr. Nanasaheb
Chandorkar, who observed Him closely, He was not Himself circumcised.
Vide article in Sai Leela on “Baba Hindu ki Yavan”, by B.V. Dev, page
562). If you call Him Hindu, He always lived in the Masjid; if
Mohammeden, He had always the Dhuni-sacred fire there, and the
following things, which are contrary to Mohammeden religion, i.e.,
grinding on the handmill, blowing of the conch and bells, oblation in
the fire, Bhajan, giving of food and worship of Baba’s Feet by means of
Arghya (water), were allowed there. If you think that He was a
Mohammeden, the best of Brahmins and Agnihotris, leaving aside their
orthodox ways, fell prostrate at His Feet. Those who went to make
enquiries about His caste, were dumb-founded and were captured by
His darshan. So, none could definitely decide, whether Sai Baba was
a Hindu or a Mohammeden*. This is no wonder for he who completely
surrenders himself to the Lord, by getting rid of his egoism and bodyconsciousness,
thus becomes one with Him, and has nothing to do with
any questions of caste or nationality. Baba saw no difference between
any two castes and even between beings. He took meat and fish with
Fakirs but did not grumble, when dogs touched the dishes with their
mouths.
Such a unique and wonderful incarnation was Sai Baba. On
account of the merits in my past birth, I had the good fortune to sit at
His Feet and enjoy His blessed company. The joy and delight I derived
therefrom, was incomparable. In fact, Sai Baba was pure Anand and
consciousness. I cannot sufficiently describe Him, His greatness and
uniqueness. He who took delight at His Feet, was established in His
own self. Many Sanyaasis, Sadhaks and all sorts of men aspiring for
salvation came to Sai Baba. He always walked, talked and laughed
with them and always uttered “Allah Malik” (God is the sole owner).
He never liked discussion or disputation. He was always calm and
controlled, though irritable at times, always preached Vedanta and
nobody knew till the last, Who was Baba? Princes and poor people
were treated alike by Him. He knew the inmost secrets of all and when
He gave expression to them, all were surprised. He was the repository
of all knowledge, still He feigned ignorance. He also disliked honour.
Such were the characteristics of Sai Baba. Though He had a human
body, His deeds testified to His Godhood. All people considered Him
as the God in Shirdi.",
7,2,Behavior of Sai Baba,"Ignorant that I am, I cannot describe Baba’s miracles. He got
almost all the temples in Shirdi repaired. Through Tatya Patil, the
temples of Shani, Ganapati, Shankar-Parvati, Village Diety and Maruti
were put in order. His charity was also remarkable. The money He used
to collect as Dakshina, was freely distributed, Rs. 20 to some, Rs. 15 or
50 to others, every day. The recepients thought that this was 'pure'
charity money; and Baba wished that it should be usefully employed.
People benefitted immensely by having Baba’s darshan. Some
became hale and hearty, wicked people were turned into good ones.
Leprosy was cured in some cases, many got their desires fulfilled,
without any medicine being put in the eyes, some blind men got back
their sight and some lame ones got their limbs. Nobody could see the
end of His extraordinary greatness. His fame spread far and wide, and
pilgrims from all sides flocked to Shirdi. Baba had his ‘Asan’ near the
Dhuni and always rested there. He sat there in meditation, sometimes
without a bath.
He used to tie a small white turban on His head and wear a clean
Dhotar round His waist, and a shirt on His body. This was His attire in
the beginning. He first practised medicine in the village, He examined
patients and gave medicines. He was always successful and He became
famous as a Hakim (doctor). A curious case may be narrated here. One
devotee had his eyes quite red and swollen. No doctor was available in
Shirdi. The other devotees took him to Baba. In such cases other doctors
would use ointments, Anjans, cow’s milk and camphorated drugs etc.
Baba’s remedy was quite unique. He pounded some ‘Beeba’ (some Carpus
Ana Cardium, i.e. marking nuts) and made two balls of them and thrust
them on in each eye of the patient and wrapped a cloth – bandage round
them. Next day the bandage was removed and water was poured over
them. The inflammation subsided and the pupils became white and clear.
Though, the eyes are very delicate, the Beeba caused no hurt but removed
the disease of the eyes. Many such cases were cured, this is only one
instance in this regard.",
7,3,Baba's Yogic Practices,"Baba knew all the processes and practices of Yoga. Two of them
will be described here :
(1) DHAUTI KRIYA or CLEANSING PROCESS : Every third day,
Baba went to the well near Banyan tree, at a considerable distance from
the Masjid washed His mouth and had a bath. On one occasion, He
was seen throwing up His intestines, clean them inside outside and
place them on a Jamb tree for drying. There are people in Shirdi, who
have actually seen this and who have testified to this fact. Ordinary
Dhauti is done by a moistened piece of linen, 3 inches broad 22½ ft.
long. This piece is gulped down the throat and allowed to remain in
the stomach for about half an hour for being reacted there and then
taken out. But Baba’s Dhauti was quite unique and extraordinary. (2)
KHANDA YOGA : In this practice Baba extracted the limbs from His
body and left them separately at different places in the Masjid. Once a
gentleman went to the Masjid and saw the limbs of Baba lying in
separate places. He was terrified, he first thought of running to the
village officers and informing them of Baba being hacked to pieces and
murdered. He thought that perhaps he would be held responsible, as
he was the first informant and knew something of the affair. So he kept
silent. But, next day, when he went to the Masjid, he was very much
surprised to see Baba, hale and hearty as before. He thought that what
he had seen the previous day, was only a dream.
Baba practised Yoga since His infancy and nobody knew or
guessed the proficiency He had attained in it. He charged no fees for
His cures, became renowned and famous by virtue of His merits, gave
health to many a poor and suffering person. This famous Doctor of
doctors cared not for His interests, but always worked for the good and
welfare of others, Himself suffering unbearable and terrible pain many
a time in the process. One such instance I will relate now, which will
show the all-pervasive and the most merciful character of Sai Baba.",
7,4,Baba's All-pervasiveness and Mercy,"In the year 1910, Baba was sitting near the Dhuni on Diwali and
warming Himself. He was putting fire-wood into the Dhuni, which was
burning brightly. A little later instead of pushing logs of wood, Baba
pushed His arm into the Dhuni, His arm was scorched and burnt. This
was noticed by the errand boy Madhav and also by Madhavrao
Deshpande (Shama). They, at once, ran to Baba and Madhavrao clasped
Baba, by His waist from behind and dragged Him forcibly backward
and asked, “Deva, why You done this?” Then Baba came to His senses
and replied, “The wife of a blacksmith at some distant place was
working the bellows of a furnace, her husband called her, forgetting
that her child was on her lap, she got up hastily and the child slipped
into the furnace. I immediately thrust My hand into the furnace and
saved the child. I do not mind My arm being burnt but, I am glad that
the life of the child is saved.”",
7,5,Leper Devotee's Service,"On hearing the news of Baba’s hand being burnt from (Shama)
Madhavrao Deshpande, Mr. Nanasaheb Chandorkar accompanied by
the famous doctor Parmanand of Mumbai with his medical outfit,
consisting of ointments, lint and bandages etc. rushed to Shirdi and
requested Baba to allow Dr. Parmanand to examine the arm and dress
the wound, caused by the burn. This was refused. Ever since the burnt
arm was dressed by Bhagoji Shinde, a leper devotee. His treatment
consisted in massaging the burnt part with Ghee1 and then, placing a
leaf over it and bandaging it tightly. Mr. Nanasaheb Chandorkar
solicited Baba many a time to unfasten the bandages, get the wound
examined, dressed and treated by Dr. Parmanand, with the object that
it may heal fast. Dr. Parmanand himself made similar requests but Baba
postponed it by saying that Allah was His Doctor and did not allow
His arm to be examined. Dr. Parmanand’s medicines were not exposed
to the air of Shirdi and they remained intact, but he had the good
fortune of getting a darshan of Baba. Bhagoji was allowed to treat the
hand daily. After some days, the arm healed and all were happy. Still
we do not know whether any trace of pain was left or not. Every
morning, Bhagoji went through his programme of untying the bandages,
massaging the arm with ghee and tightly bandaging it again. This went
on till Sai Baba’s Samadhi (death). Sai Baba a perfect Siddha as He was
did not really want this treatment, but out of love for His devotee, He
allowed the ‘Upasana’ – service of Bhagoji to go on uninterrupted all
along. When Baba started for Lendi, Bhagoji held an umbrella over Him
and accompanied Him. Every morning when Baba sat near the post
close to the Dhuni, Bhagoji was present and started his service. Bhagoji
was a sinner in his past birth. He was suffering from leprosy, his
fingers had shrunk, his body was full of pus and smelling badly.
Though outwardly he seemed so unfortunate, he was really very lucky
and happy, for he was the premier servant of Baba, and got the benefit
of His company.",
7,6,Master Khaparde's Plague Case,"I shall now relate another instance of Baba’s wonderful Leela.
Mrs. Khaparde, the wife of Mr. Dadasaheb Khaparde of Amaravati, was
staying at Shirdi with her young son for some days. One day the son
got high fever, which further developed into bubonic plague. The mother
was frightened and felt most uneasy. She thought of leaving the place
for Amaravati and went near Baba in the evening, when He was coming
near the Wada (now Samadhi Mandir) in His evening rounds, for
asking His permission. She informed Him in a trembling tone, that her
dear young son was down with plague. Baba spoke kindly and softly
to her, saying that the sky is beset with clouds; but they will melt and
pass off and everything will be smooth and clear. So saying He lifted
up His Kafni up to the waist and showed to all present, four fully
developed bubos, as big as eggs and added, “See, how I have to suffer
for My devotees, their difficulties are Mine.” Seeing this unique and
extraordinary deed (Leela), the people were convinced as to how the
saints suffer pains for their devotees. The hearts of the saints is softer
than wax, it is soft in and out as butter. They love their devotees without
any idea of gain, and regard them as their true relatives.",
7,7,Going to Pandharpur,"I shall now close this chapter, after relating a story illustrating
how Sai Baba loved His devotees and anticipated their wishes and
movements. Mr. Nanasaheb Chandorkar, who was a great devotee of
Baba, was Mamlatdar1 at Nandurbar in Khandesh. He got an order of
transfer to Pandharpur. His devotion to Sai Baba bore fruit, as he got
an order to go and stay at Pandharpur which is regarded as the
‘Bhuvaikuntha’ – Heaven on the earth. Nanasaheb had to take immediate
charge, so he left for the place without even writing or informing anybody
at Shirdi. He wanted to give a surprise visit at Shirdi – his Pandharpur,
see and salute his Vithoba (Baba) and then proceed further. Nobody
knew of Nanasaheb’s departure for Shirdi but Sai Baba knew all about
this, as His eyes were everywhere (omniscient). As soon as Nanasaheb
approached Nimgaon, a few miles from Shirdi, there was a stir in the
masjid at Shirdi. Baba was sitting and talking with Mhalsapati, Appa
Shinde and Kashiram, when He at once said, “Let us all four do some
Bhajan, the doors of Pandhari are open, let us sing merrily!” Then they
began to sing in chorus, the bhava of the song being “I have to go to
Pandharpur and I have to stay on there, for it is the house of my Lord.”
Baba sang and the devotees followed Him. After a shortwhile
Nanasaheb came there with his family, prostrated before Baba and
requested Him to accompany them to Pandharpur and stay with them
there. This solicitation was not necessary, as the devotees told Nanasaheb
that Baba was already in the mood of going to Pandharpur and staying
there. Hearing this Nanasaheb was moved and fell at Baba’s Feet. Then
after getting Baba’s permission, Udi (sacred ash) and blessings,
Nanasaheb left for Pandharpur.
There is no end to Baba’s stories; but let me now stop here,
reserving for the next chapter other topics, such as importance of human
life, Baba’s living on alms, Baijabai’s service and other stories.
Bow to Shri Sai – Peace be to all",
8,1,Introduction,"As hinted in the last chapter, Hemadpant now explains
at length in his preliminary remarks, the importance of
human birth and then proceeds to relate, how Sai Baba begged His
food; how Baijabai served Him; how He slept in the Masjid, with Tatya
Kote Patil and Mhalsapati and how He loved Khushalchand of Rahata.
",
8,2,Importance of Human Birth,"In this wonderful universe, God has created millions (84 lakhs1
according to Hindu shastra calculation) of creatures (including Gods,
demi-gods, insects, beasts and men) inhabiting heaven, hell, earth, ocean,
sky and other intermediate regions. Of these, those creatures or souls,
whose merits preponderate, go to heaven and live there till they enjoy
the fruits of their actions and when this is done, they are cast down;
while those souls, whose sins or demerits preponderate, go down to
hell and suffer the consequences of their misdeeds for as long as they
deserve it. When their merits and demerits balance each other, they are
born on earth as human beings and are given a chance to work out their
salvation. Ultimately, when their merits and demerits both are worked
out completely, they get their deliverance and become free. To put the
matter in a nutshell, souls get their birth or transmigration according
to their deeds and evolvement.",
8,3,Special Value of the Human Body,"As we all know, four things are common to all the creatures, viz.,
food, sleep, fear and sexual union. In the case of man, he is endowed
with a special faculty, viz, knowledge, with the help of which he can
attain God-vision, which is impossible in any other species. It is for this
reason that gods envy the human species and aspire to be born as men
on earth, so as to get their final deliverance.
Some say that there is nothing worse than the human body, which
is full of filth, mucus, phlegm and dirt and which is subject to decay,
disease and death. This is true to a certain extent, but in spite of these
drawbacks and defects, the special value of the human body is – that
man has got the capacity to acquire knowledge. It is only due to the
human body or on account of it, that one can think of the perishable
and transitory nature of the body itself and of the world, and have
aversion for sense-enjoyments, and can discriminate between the unreal
and the real, and thus attain God-vision. So, if we reject or neglect the
body, because it is filthy, we lose the chance of God-vision and if we
indulge it and run after sense-enjoyments, because it is precious, we go
to hell. The proper course, therefore, for us to pursue, is the following;
that the body should neither be neglected nor fondled, but should be
properly cared for, just as a traveller on horse-back takes care of his
horse on the way, till he reaches his destination and returns home.
Thus, the body should ever be used or engaged to attain God-vision or
self-realization, which is the supreme end of life.
It is said that, though God created various kinds of creatures, He
was not satisfied, for none of them was able to know and appreciate His
work. So he had to create a special being – man, and endow him with
a special faculty, viz, Knowledge; and when He saw that man was able
to appreciate His Leela, marvellous work and intelligence, He was
highly pleased and satisfied. (Vide, Bhagawat, 11-9-28) So really, it is
fortunate to get a human body, better still to be born in a Brahmin family
and best, to get an opportunity of being close to Sai Baba’s Feet and
surrendering to Him.",
8,4,Man's Endeavour,"Realizing how precious human life is and knowing that death is
certain and may snatch us at any time, we should be ever alert to
achieve the object of our lives, we should not make the least delay, but
make every possible haste to gain our object, just as a king leaves no
stone unturned to seek his lost son. So with all earnestness, we should
strive to attain our end, i.e. self-realization. Casting aside laziness,
warding off drowsiness, we should day and night meditate on the self.
If we fail to do this, we reduce ourselves to the level of beasts.",
8,5,How to Proceed?,"The most effective and speedy way to gain our object is to approach
a worthy saint or sage – Sadguru, who has himself attained God-vision.
What cannot be achieved by hearing religious discourses and study of
religious texts is easily obtained in the company of such worthy souls.
Just as the sun only gives light, which all the stars put together cannot
do, so the Sadguru alone imparts spiritual wisdom, which all the
sacred books and sermons cannot do. His movements and simple talks
give us ‘silent’ advice. The virtues of forgiveness, calmness,
disinterestedness, charity, benevolence, control of mind and body,
egolessness etc. are observed by the disciples, as they are being practised
in such pure and holy company. This enlightens their minds and lifts
them up spiritually. Sai Baba was such a Sage or Sadguru. Though He
acted as a Fakir (mendicant), He was always engrossed in Self. He
always loved all beings, in whom He saw God or Divinity. By pleasures
He was not elated. He was not depressed by misfortunes. A king and
a pauper were the same to Him. He Whose glance would turn a beggar
into a king, used to go begging food from door to door in Shirdi, and
let us now see how He did it.
",
8,6,Baba's Begging Food,"Blessed are the people of Shirdi, in front of whose houses, Baba
stood as a beggar and called out, “Oh Mai, give Me a piece of bread!”
and spread out His hand to receive the same. In one hand He carried
a Tumrel (tinpot) and in the other a Zoli or Choupadari, i.e., a rectangular
piece of cloth. He visited certain houses daily. Liquid or semi-liquid
things, such as soup, vegetables, milk or butter-milk, were received in
the tinpot, while cooked rice, bread and such solid things were taken
in the Zoli. Baba’s tongue knew no taste, as He had acquired control
over it. So how could He care for the taste of different things mixed up
together? Whatever things He got in His Zoli and in the tinpot, were
mixed together and partaken by Baba to His heart’s content. Whether
particular things were tasty or otherwise, was never noticed by Baba,
as His tongue was devoid of the sense of taste altogether. Baba begged
till noon, but His begging was very irregular. Some days He went a few
rounds on other days up to twelve noon. The food thus collected was
kept in a Kundi, i.e., earthen pot. Dogs, cats and crows freely ate from
it and Baba never drove them away. The woman who swept the floor
of the Masjid, took some 10 or 12 pieces of bread to her house and
nobody prevented her from doing so. How could He, Who, even in
dreams never warded off cats and dogs by harsh words and signs,
refuse food to poor helpless people? Blessed indeed is the life of such
a Noble Person! People in Shirdi took Him in the beginning for a mad
Fakir. He was known in the village by this name. How could one, who
lived on alms by begging a few crumbs of bread, be revered and
worshipped? But this Fakir was very liberal of heart, detached and
charitable. Though He looked restless from outside, He was firm and
steady inside. His way was inscrutable. Still in that small village, there
were a few kind and blessed people, who recognized and regarded Him
as a Great Soul. One such person's account is given below.",
8,7,Baijabai's Brilliant Service,"Tatya Kote’s mother, Baijabai, used to go to the woods every after
noon with a basket on her head containing bread and vegetables. She
roamed in the jungles kos (about 3 miles) after kos, trampling bushes
and shrubs in search of the mad Fakir and after finding Him, fell at His
Feet. The Fakir sat calm and motionless in meditation, while she placed
a leaf before Him, spread her things-eatables, bread, vegetables etc.
thereon, and fed Him. Wonderful was her faith and service. Every day
she roamed at noon in the jungles and insisted upon Baba to partake
of the lunch. Her service, Upasana or penance, by whatever name we
call it, was never forgotten by Baba till the end. Remembering fully what
service she rendered, Baba benefitted her son significantly. Both the son
and the mother, had great faith in the Fakir, Who was their God. Baba
often said to them that “Fakiri (mendicacy) is real, Lordship (riches) is
transient.” After some years Baba stopped going into the woods and
began to live in the village, and take His food in the Masjid thus,
Baijabai’s troubles of roaming in the jungles ended.",
8,8,Dormitory of Trio,"Ever blessed are the saints, in whose heart Lord Vasudeva dwells
and fortunate indeed are the devotees, who get the benefit of the company
of such saints. Two such fortunate fellows, Tatya Kote Patil and Bhagat
Mhalsapati, equally shared the company of Sai Baba. Baba also loved
them both. These three persons slept in the Masjid with their heads
towards the east, west and north, and with their feet touching one
another's at the centre. After spreading their beds, they lay on them,
chitchatting and gossiping till late at night. If any one of them showed
any signs of sleep, others would wake him up. For instance, if Tatya
began to snore, Baba at once got up and shook him from side to side
and pressed his head. If it was Mhalsapati, He pulled him close, stroked
his legs and patted his back. In this way for a period of 14 years, Tatya,
leaving his parents at home, slept in the Masjid on account of his deep
love for Baba. How happy and never to be forgotten were those days!
How to measure that love and how to value the grace of Baba! After the
passing away of his father, Tatya took charge of the household affairs
and began to sleep at home.",
8,9,Khushalchand of Rahata,"Baba loved Ganpat Kote Patil of Shirdi. He loved
Chandrabhansheth Marwadi of Rahata equally. After the demise of this
Sheth, Baba loved his nephew Khushalchand equally or perhaps more,
and looked after his welfare, day and night. Some times in a bullock
cart, at other times in a tonga1, with intimate devotees Baba went to
Rahata. People of that village would come out with band and music
and receive Baba at the gate of the village and prostrate before Him.
Then He was taken into the village with great honour and ceremony.
Khushalchand took Baba to his house, seated Him on a comfortable
seat and gave Him a good meal. Then they talked freely and merrily for
some time, after which Baba returned to Shirdi, giving delight and
blessings to all.
Shirdi is midway and equi-distant from Rahata on one side (south)
and Nimgaon on the other (north). Baba never went beyond these
places during His life time. He never saw any train nor travelled by it.
Still He knew exactly the timings of arrivals and departures of all trains.
Devotees who acted according to Baba’s instructions given at the time
of taking His leave, fared well, while those who disregarded them,
suffered many a mishap and accident. More about this and other matters
will be told in the next chapter.
Bow to Shri Sai – Peace be to all",
9,1,Characteristic of Shirdi - Pilgrimage,"At the end of the last chapter, it was briefly stated that the Bhaktas,
who obeyed Baba’s orders at the time of taking leave, fared well and
those, who disobeyed them, suffered many a mishap. This statement
will be amplified and illustrated, with a few striking instances, and by
other matters dealt with in this chapter.
Characteristic of Shirdi – Pilgrimage
One special peculiarity of Shirdi-pilgrimage was, that none could
leave Shirdi, without Baba’s permission and if he did, he invited troubles;
but if any one was asked to quit Shirdi, he could stay there no longer.
Baba gave certain suggestions or hints, when devotees went to bid
good-bye and take leave. These suggestions had to be followed. If they
were not followed or were departed from, accidents were sure to befall
them. We give below a few instances.",
9,2,Tatya Kote Patil's Tonga Ride,"Tatya Kote was once going in a tonga to Kopargaon bazaar. He
came in haste to the Masjid, saluted Baba, and said that he would go
to Kopargaon bazaar. Baba said, “Don’t make haste, stop a little, forget
the bazaar, don’t go out of the village”. On seeing his anxiousness to
go, Baba asked him to take Shama (Madhavrao Deshpande), with him.
Not minding this direction, Tatya Kote immediately drove off his tonga.
Of the two horses, one, which cost Rs. 300/-, was very active and
restless. After passing Sawli Vihir, it began to run rashly, got a sprain
in its waist and fell down. Tatya was not much hurt but, was reminded
of Mother Sai’s direction. On another occasion, while proceeding to
Kolhar village, he disregarded Baba’s direction and drove in a tonga,
which met with a similar accident.",
9,3,European Gentleman,"One European gentleman of Mumbai once came to Shirdi, with an
introductory note from Nanasaheb Chandorkar, and with some object
in view. He was comfortably accommodated in a tent. He wanted to
kneel before Baba and kiss His hand. Therefore, he tried thrice to step
into the Masjid but Baba prevented him from doing so. He was asked
to sit in the open courtyard below and take Baba’s darshan from there.
Not pleased with the reception he got, he wanted to leave Shirdi at once
and came to bid good-bye. Baba asked him to go the next day and not
to hurry. People also requested him to abide by Baba’s instructions. Not
listening to all this he left Shirdi in a tonga. The horses ran all right but
when Sawli Vihir was passed, a bicycle came in front, on seeing which
the horses were frightened and ran fast. The tonga turned topsy-turvy
and the gentleman fell down, and was dragged over some distance. He
was immediately rescued, but had to go and lie in Kopargaon hospital,
for the treatment of his injuries. Such experiences were legion, and
people learnt the lesson, that those who disobeyed Baba’s instructions,
met with accidents in one way or the other, and those who obeyed them,
were safe and happy.",
9,4,The Necessity of Mendicancy,"Now to return to the question of mendicancy. A question may
arise in the minds of some that, if Baba was such a great personage-God
manifest, why should He have taken recourse to begging bowl
throughout His life? This question may be considered and replied from
two standpoints. (1) Who are the people, who have a right to live by the
begging-bowl? Our Shastras say that those persons, who, after getting
rid of or becoming free from the three main desires, viz. (1) for progeny,
(2) for wealth, (3) for fame, and accept Sanyaas, are the fit persons to
live by begging alms. They cannot make cooking arrangements and
dine at their home. The duty of feeding them is laid on the shoulders
of house-holders. Sai Baba was neither a house-holder nor Vanaprastha.
He was a celibate Sanyaasi, i.e. Sanyaasi from boy-hood. His firm
conviction was that the universe was His home He was the Lord
Vasudeva – the Supporter of the universe and the Imperishable Brahma.
So, He had full right to take recourse to begging. (2) Now, from the
standpoint of *Panchasoona – five sins and their atonement. We all
know that in order to prepare food-stuffs and meals, the house-holders
have to go through five actions or processes, viz. (1) Kandani – Pounding,
(2) Peshani – Grinding, (3) Udakumbhi – Washing pots, (4) Marjani –
Sweeping and Cleaning, (5) Chulli – Lighting hearths. These processes",
9,5,Devotees' Experience and Offering,"Now to return to the other more interesting subject ... Lord Krishna
has said in the Bhagvad Gita (9-26), “Whosoever devoutly offers to Me
a leaf, a flower or a fruit or water, of that pure-hearted man, I accept
that pious offering.” In the case of Sai Baba, if a devotee intended really
to offer anything to Sai Baba, and if he afterwards forgot to offer the
same, Baba reminded him or his friend about the offering, and made
him bring it to Him and then accepted it, and blessed the devotee. A few
instances are given below.",
9,6,Tarkhad Family (Father and Son),"Mr. Ramachandra Atmaram alias Babasaheb Tarkhad, formerly a
Prarthana Samajist, was a staunch devotee of Sai Baba. His wife and
son loved Baba equally or perhaps more. It was once proposed that
Master Tarkhad should go with his mother to Shirdi and spend his
summer vacation there; but the son was unwilling to go, as he thought
that, in case, he left his home in Bandra, the worship of Sai Baba in the
house would not be properly attended to as his father, being a Prarthana
Samajist, would not care to worship Sai Baba’s picture. However, on his
father’s giving an assurance under oath that, he would perform the
worship exactly as his son was doing, the mother and the son left for
Shirdi on a Friday night.
Next day (Saturday) Mr. Tarkhad got up early, took his bath and
before proceeding with the Puja, prostrated himself before the Shrine
and said, “Baba, I am going to perform the Puja exactly as my son has
been doing but please, let it not be a formal drill.” Saying so, he performed
the Puja and offered a few pieces of lump-sugar as Naivaidya (offering).
The sugar was distributed at lunch time .
That evening and next day-Sunday, everything went on well. The
following Monday was a working day and it also passed well. Mr.
Tarkhad, who had never performed Puja like this in all his life, felt great
confidence within himself, that every thing was passing on quite
satisfactorily, as per the promise given to the son. Next Tuesday, he
performed the morning Puja as usual and left for his work. Coming
home at noon, he found that, there was no Prasad (sugar) to partake of,
when the meal was served. He asked the servant-cook, who told him
that there was no offering made that morning, and that he had completely
forgotten to perform that part of the Puja (offering Naivaidya). At this,
he left his seat and prostrated himself before the Shrine, expressed his
regret at the same time chiding Baba for the want of guidance in making
the whole affair a matter of mere drill. Then, he wrote a letter to his son,
stating the facts and requested him to lay it at Baba’s Feet, and ask His
pardon for his neglect.
This happened in Bandra at about Tuesday noon.
At about the same time, when the noon Arati was about to
commence in Shirdi, Baba said to Mrs. Tarkhad, “Mother, I had been
to your house in Bandra, with a view to have something to eat. I found
the door locked. I, somehow, got an entry and found to My regret that
Bhau (Mr. Tarkhad) had left nothing to eat for Me. So, I have returned
with my hunger unappeased”.
The lady did not understand this but the son, who was close – by,
understood the whole thing that there was something wrong with the
Puja in Bandra and he therefore, requested Baba to permit him to go
home. Baba refused this, but allowed him to perform Puja there. Then,
the son wrote a letter to his father stating all that took place at Shirdi
and implored his father not to neglect the Puja at home.
Both these letters crossed each other and were delivered to the
respective parties the next day. Is this not wonderful?",
9,7,Mrs. Tarkhad,"Let us now take up the case of Mrs. Tarkhad herself. She offered
three things, viz. (1) Bharit (roasted brinjal mixed with curds and
spice), (2) Kacharya (circular pieces of brinjal fried in ghee), (3) Pedha
(sweetmeat ball). Let us see, how Baba accepted these.
Once Mr. Raghuvir Bhaskar Purandare of Bandra, a great devotee
of Baba started for Shirdi with family. Mrs. Tarkhad went to Mrs.
Purandare and gave her two brinjals and requested her to prepare
Bharit of one brinjal and Kacharya of the other, when she went to Shirdi
and serve Baba with them. After reaching Shirdi, Mrs. Purandare went
with her dish of Bharit to the Masjid, when Baba was just sitting for
meals. Baba found the Bharit very tasty. So, He distributed it to all and
said that, He wanted Kacharya now. A word was sent to
Radhakrishnamai that, Baba wanted Kacharya. She was in a fix, as that
was no season of brinjals. How to get brinjals was the question? When
an enquiry was made as to who brought the Bharit, it was found that
Mrs. Purandare was entrusted with the duty of serving Kacharya.
Everybody then came to know the significance of Baba’s enquiry
regarding Kacharya and was wonder-struck at Baba’s all-pervasive
knowledge.
In December, 1915, one Govind Balaram Mankar wanted to go to
Shirdi to perform the obsequies of his father. Before he left, he came to
see Mr. Tarkhad. Then Mrs. Tarkhad wanted to send something with
him to Baba. She searched the whole house, but found nothing except
a Pedha, which had already been offered as Naivaidya. The boy Govind
was in mourning. Out of great devotion to Baba, she sent the Pedha
with him, hoping that Baba would accept and eat it. Govind went to
Shirdi and saw Baba but forgot to take the Pedha with him. Baba simply
waited. When again he went to Baba in the afternoon, he went emptyhanded,
without the Pedha. Baba could wait no longer and did ask him
straight, “What did you bring for Me?” “Nothing” was the reply. Baba
asked him again. The same reply came forth again. Then, Baba asked
him the question, “Did not the mother (Mrs. Tarkhad) give some
sweetmeat to you for Me, at the time of your starting?” The boy then
remembered the whole thing. He felt abashed, asked Baba’s pardon, ran
to his lodging, brought the Pedha and gave it to Baba. As soon as Baba
got it in His hand, He put it into His mouth and gulped it down. Thus,
the devotion of Mrs. Tarkhad was recognised and accepted. “As men
believe in Me, so do I accept them” (Gita, 4-11) was proved in this case.",
9,8,Baba Fed Sumptuously,"Once, Mrs. Tarkhad was staying in a certain house in Shirdi. At
noon meals were ready and being served, when a hungry dog turned
up there and began to bark. Mrs. Tarkhad got up at once and threw a
piece of bread which the dog gulped with great relish. In the afternoon
when she went to the Masjid and sat at some distance, Sai Baba said
to her, “Mother, you have fed Me sumptuously, My famished Pranas
(life-forces) have been satisfied. Ever act like this, and this will stand
you in good stead. Sitting in this Masjid I shall never, never speak
untruth. Take pity on Me like this! First give bread to the hungry and
then, eat yourself. Note this well!” She could not understand at first the
meaning of what Baba said. So, she replied, “Baba, how could I feed
You? I am myself dependent on others and take my food from them on
payment.” Then, Baba replied, “Eating that lovely bread I am heartily
contended and I am still belching. The dog, which you saw before
meals and to which you gave the piece of bread, is one with Me, so
also other creatures (cats, pigs, flies, cows etc.) are one with Me. I am
roaming in their forms. He, who sees Me in all these creatures, is My
beloved. So, abandon the sense of duality and distinction, and serve
Me as you did today.” Drinking these nectar-like words she was moved,
her eyes were brimmed with tears, her throat was choked and her joy
knew no bounds.",
9,9,Moral of Chapter 9,"“See God in all beings!” is the moral of this chapter. The
Upanishads, the Gita and the Bhagawat, all exhort us to perceive God
or Divinity in all the creatures. By the instance, given at the end of this
chapter and other numerous to mention, Sai Baba has practically
demonstrated to us, how to put the Upanishadic teachings into practice.
In this way Sai Baba stands as the best Exponent or Teacher of the
Upanishadic doctrines.
Bow to Shri Sai – Peace be to all",
10,1,Chapter 10 - Introduction,"Remember Him (Sai Baba) always with love, for He
was ever engrossed in doing good to all, and always
abided in His Self. To remember Him only, is to solve the riddle of life
and death. This is the best and easiest of Sadhanas, as it involves no
expenditure. A little exertion here brings great rewards. So, as long as
our senses are sound, we should, minute by minute, practise this
Sadhana. All other Gods are illusory, Guru is the only God. If we
believe in Sadguru’s holy feet, He can change our fortune for the better.
If we serve him sincerely, we get rid of our worldly afflictions. We need
not study any philosophy, like the Nyaya1 and the Mimansa. As we
trust the helmsman in crossing rivers and seas, so, we have to trust
our Sadguru in getting over the ocean of worldly existence. The Sadguru
looks to the intense feeling and devotion of his devotees, endows them
with knowledge and eternal bliss.
In the last chapter, Baba’s mendicancy and devotees’ experiences
and other subjects are dealt with. Let the readers now read, where and
how Baba lived, how He slept and how He taught etc.",
10,2,Baba's Wonderful Bedstead,"Let us first see where and how Baba slept, Mr. Nanasaheb Dengle
brought for Sai Baba, a wooden plank, about 4 arms in length and only
a span in breath, for sleeping upon. Instead of keeping the plank on the
floor and then sleeping on it, Baba tied it like a swing to the rafters of
the Masjid with old shreds or rags and commenced to sleep upon it. The
rags were so thin and worn out that it was a wonder, how they could
bear or support the weight of the plank itself, let alone the weight of
Baba. But, somehow or other it was Baba’s sheer Leela that the worn
out rags did sustain the plank, along with the weight of Baba on it. On
the four corners of this plank, Baba lighted Panatis (earthen lamps), one
at each corner and kept them burning the whole night. It was a sight
for the gods to see Baba sitting or sleeping on this plank! It was a
wonder to all, how Baba got up and down the plank. Out of curiosity,
many observers kept watching the process of mounting and
dismounting, but none succeeded. As crowds began to swell, so as to
detect this wonderful feat, Baba one day broke the plank into pieces and
threw it away. Baba had all the eight Maha Siddhis (powers) at His
command. He neither practised nor craved for them. They came to Him
naturally, as a result of His spiritual perfection.",
10,3,Manifestation of Brahma,"Though, Sai Baba looked like a man, three cubits and a half in
length, still He dwelt in the hearts of all. Inwardly, He was unattached
and indifferent but outwardly, He longed for mass welfare. Though,
inwardly, an abode of peace, He looked outwardly restless. Inwardly,
He had the state of Brahma, outwardly he seemed engrossed in the
world. Some times He looked on all with affection and at times He
threw stones at them; some times He scolded them, while at times He
embraced them and was calm, composed, tolerant and well-balanced.
He always abided and was engrossed in the Self, and was well-disposed
towards His Bhaktas. He always sat on one Asan and never travelled.
His ‘satka’ was a small stick, which He always carried in His hand.
He was calm and thought-free. He never cared for wealth and fame, and
lived on alms. Such a life He led. He always uttered “Allah Malik” (God
is the real owner). Entire and unbroken was His love for the Bhaktas.
He was the mine or store-house for self-knowledge and full of Divine
Bliss. Such was the Divine Form of Sai Baba, boundless, endless and
undifferentiated. One principle, which envelopes the whole universe
(from a stone to Brahma), incarnated in Sai Baba. The really meritorious
and fortunate people got this treasure-grove in their hands, while those
people, who not knowing the real worth of Sai Baba, took Him to be a
mere human being, were indeed unfortunate.",
10,4,His Stay in Shirdi and Probable Birth-date,"None knew or knows the parents and the exact date of birth of Sai
Baba; but it can be approximately determined by His stay in Shirdi.
Baba first came to Shirdi when he was a young lad of sixteen and
stayed there for three years. Then, all of a sudden, He disappeared for
some time. After some time, He reappeared in the Nizam state, near
Aurangabad and again came to Shirdi, with the marriage-party of
Chand Patil, when He was about twenty years old. Thence, He stayed
in Shirdi for an unbroken period of sixty years, after which Baba took
His Maha-samadhi in the year 1918. From this, we can say that the year
of Baba’s birth is approximately 1838 A.D.",
10,5,Baba's Mission and Advice,"Saint Ramdas (1608-1681) flourished in the 17th century, and
fulfilled to a great extent his mission of protecting cows and Brahmins
against the Yavanas (Mohammedens); but within two centuries after
him, the split between the two communities – Hindus and Mohammedens
widened up and Sai Baba came to bridge that gulf. His constant advice
to all was to this effect. “Ram (the God of the Hindus) and Rahim (the
God of the Mohammedens) were one and the same; there was not the
slightest difference between them then, why should their devotees fall
out and quarrel among themselves? You ignorant folk, join hands and
bring both the communities together, act sanely and thus, you will gain
your object of national unity. It is not good to dispute and argue. So,
don’t argue, don’t emulate others. Always consider your interest and
welfare. The Lord will protect you. Yoga, sacrifice, penance and
knowledge are the means to attain God. If you do not succeed in this
by any means, in vain is your birth. If anyone does any evil unto you,
do not retaliate. If you can do anything, do some good unto others.”
This in short was Sai Baba’s advice to all, and this will stand us in
good stead both in material and spiritual matters.",
10,6,Sai Baba as Sadguru,"There are many so-called Gurus, who go about from house to
house with cymbals and Vina in their hands, and make a show of their
spirituality. They blow Mantras into the ears of their disciples and
extract money from them. They profess to teach piety and religion to
their disciples, but are themselves impious and irreligious. Sai Baba
never thought of making the least show of His worth (piety). He had
no Body-consciousness but He had great love for His disciples. There
are two kinds of Gurus (1) ‘Niyat’ (appointed or fixed) and (2) ‘Aniyat’
(unappointed or general). The latter by their advice develop the good
qualities in us, purify our hearts and set us on the path of salvation;
but contact with the former, dispels our sense of dualities (sense of
difference), and establishes us in Unity by making us realize “Thou art
that”. There are various Gurus imparting to us various kinds of worldly
knowledge but he, who fixes us in our Nature (Self) and carries us
beyond the ocean of worldly existence, is the Sadguru. Sai Baba was
such a Sadguru. His greatness is indescribable. If anybody went to take
His darshan, He, without being asked, would give every detail of his
past, present and future. He saw Divinity in all beings. Friends and foes
were alike to Him. Disinterested and balanced, He obliged the evildoers
as well as the pious. He was the same in prosperity and adversity.
No doubt ever touched Him. Though, He acted through the body He
was, not in the least, attached to His body or house. Though, He looked
embodied, He was really unembodied, i.e., free from gross existence.
Blessed are the people of Shirdi, who worshipped Sai as their
God. While eating, drinking, working in their backyards and fields, and
doing various household works, they always remembered Sai and sang
His glory. They knew no other God except Sai. What to speak of the
sweetness of the love of the women of Shirdi! They were quite ignorant
but their pure love inspired them to compose poems or songs in their
simple rustic language. Letters of learning they had none, still one can
discern real poetry in their simple songs. It is not intelligence, but love,
that inspires real poetry as such. Real poetry is the manifestation of true
love, and this can be seen and appreciated by intelligent listeners.
Collection of these folk-songs is desirable and by Baba's wish some
fortunate devotee may undertake the task of compiling and publishing
these folk-songs, either in the Sai Leela magazine or separately in a
book.",
10,7,Baba's Humility,"Lord or Bhagwan is said to have six qualities, viz. (1) Fame, (2)
Wealth, (3) Non-attachment, (4) Knowledge, (5) Grandeur and (6)
Liberality. Baba had all these in Him. He incarnated in flesh, for the
sake of Bhaktas. Wonderful was His grace and kindness, for He drew
the devotees to Him, or how else could one have known Him. For the
sake of His Bhaktas Baba spoke such words, the Goddess of Speech
could not utter. Here is a specimen. Baba spoke very humbly as follows :
“Slave of slaves I am your debtor. I am satisfied at your darshan. It is
a great favour that I saw your feet. I am an insect in your excreta. I
consider Myself blessed thereby.” What humility is this!
Though, outwardly Baba seemed to enjoy sense-objects, He had
not the least flavour in them, nor even the consciousness of enjoying
them. Though, He ate, He had no taste and though, He saw, He never
felt any interest in what He saw. Regarding passion, He was as perfect
a celibate as Hanuman. He was not attached to anything. He was pure
consciousness, the resting place of desire, anger, envy and other feelings.
In short, He was disinterested, free and perfect. A striking instance may
be cited in illustration of this statement.",
10,8,Nanavali,"There was in Shirdi, a very quaint and queer fellow, by name
Nanavali. He looked to Baba’s work and affairs. He once approached
Baba, Who was seated on His Gadi (seat) and asked Him to get up, as
he wanted to occupy the same. Baba, at once got up and left the seat,
which he had occupied. After sitting there a while Nanavali got up, and
asked Baba to resume His seat. Then, Baba sat down and Nanavali fell
at His feet. Baba did not show the slightest displeasure in being dictated
to or ousted.
This Nanavali loved Baba so much that, he breathed his last, on
the thirteenth day of Baba’s Maha-samadhi.
The Easiest Path : Hearing the stories of the saints and being in their
company
Though, Sai Baba acted outwardly like an ordinary man, His
action showed extraordinary wisdom and skill. Whatever He did, was
done for the good of His devotees. He never prescribed any Asan,
regulation of breathing or any rites to His Bhaktas, nor did He blow any
Mantra into their ears. He told them to leave off all cleverness, and
always remember “Sai” “Sai”. If you did that, He said, all your
shackles would be removed and you would be free. Sitting through
five fires, sacrifices, chantings, eight-fold Yoga are possible for the
Brahmins only, they are of no use to the other classes. The function of
the mind is to think, it cannot remain without thinking for a minute. If
you give it a sense-object, it will think about it. If you give it Guru, it
will think about Guru. You have heard most attentively the grandeur
of Sai. This is the natural rememberance of Sai. Hearing the stories of
the saints is not so difficult, as the other Sadhanas, mentioned above.
They (stories) remove all fear of this Sansar (worldly existence) and take
you on to the spiritual path. So, listen to these stories, meditate on them
and assimilate them. You may attend to your worldly duties, but give
your mind to Sai and His stories, and then, He is sure to bless you. This
is the easiest path, but why do not all take to it? The reason is that
without God’s grace, we do not get the desire to listen to the stories of
saints. With God’s grace everything is smooth and easy. Hearing the
stories of the saints is, in a way, keeping their company. The importance
of the company of the saints is very great. It removes our bodyconsciousness
and egoism, destroys completely the chain of our birth
and death, cuts asunder all the knots of the mind and takes us to God,
Who is pure consciousness. It certainly increases our non-attachment
to sense-objects and makes us quite indifferent to pleasures and pains,
and leads us onward on the spiritual path. If you have no other
Sadhana, such as uttering God’s name, worship or devotion etc. but if
you take refuge in them (saints) whole-heartedly, they will carry you off
safely across the ocean of worldly existence. It is for this reason that the
saints manifest themselves in this world. Even sacred rivers such as the
Ganges, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri etc., which wash away the sins
of the world, desire that the saints should come to them, for a bath and
purify them. Such is the grandeur of the Saint. It is on account of the
store of merit in past births that we have attained the feet of Sai Baba.
We conclude this chapter with meditation on Sai’s Form. He, the
graceful and handsome Sai, standing on the edge of the Masjid and
distributing Udi to each and every Bhakta, with a view to his welfare,
He, Who thinks of the world as an illusion and Who is ever engrossed
in Supreme Bliss – before Him, we humbly prostrate ourselves.
Bow to Shri Sai – Peace be to all",
11,1,Sai as Sagun Brahma,"Let us now, in this chapter, describe the manifested
(Sagun) Brahma Sai, as to how He was worshipped
and how He controlled the elements.
Sai as Sagun Brahma
There are two aspects of God or Brahma : (1) the Unmanifested
(Nirgun) and (2) the Manifested (Sagun). The Nirgun is formless, while
the Sagun is with form, though, both denote the same Brahma. Some
prefer to worship the former, some the latter. As stated in the Gita
(chapter XIII) the worship of the latter is easy and preferable. As man
has got a form (body, senses, etc.), it is natural and easy for him to
worship the God with form. Our love and devotion do not develop,
unless we worship Sagun Brahma, for a certain period of time, and as
we advance, it leads us to the worship (meditation) of Nirgun Brahma.
So, let us start with Sagun worship. Image, altar, fire, light, sun, water,
Brahma are the seven objects of worship; but Sadguru is better than all
these. Let us, on this occasion, bring to our mind the form of Sai, Who
was non-attachment Incarnate, and Who was a resting-place for His
devotees. Our faith in His words is the Asan; and our Sankalpa
(determination to accomplish the Puja) is the abandonment of all our
desires. Some say that Sai was a Bhagwad-bhakta (devotee of the Lord),
others say He was a Maha-bhagwat (a great devotee); but to us He is
God Incarnate. He was ever forgiving, never irritable, straight, soft,
tolerant and content beyond comparison. Though, He looked embodied
(as having the form), He was really dis-embodied, emotionless,
unattached and internally free. The Ganges on its way to the sea, cools
and refreshes the creatures affected with heat, gives life to the crops and
trees, and quenches the thirst of many. Similarly, saints (Souls) like Sai,
while they live their own, give solace and comfort to all. Lord Krishna
has said that the saint is My soul, My living image, I am He or He is
My pure form (Being). This in-describable Shakti or Power of God,
known as Pure Existence, Knowledge and Bliss, incarnated in the form
of Sai in Shirdi. The Shruti (Taittiriya Upanishad) describes Brahma as
Pure Bliss. This, we read or hear daily in the books, but the devout
people experienced this Brahma or Bliss in Shirdi. Baba, the Support of
all, required no prop or Asan from anybody. He always used a piece
of sack-cloth for His seat, which was covered with a small mattress by
His bhaktas and had a bolster, placed by them, rest as His back. Baba
respected the feelings of His devotees and allowed them to worship
Him as they liked. Some waved Chamar or fans before Him, some
played on musical instruments, some washed His hands and Feet,
some others applied scent and Chandan, some gave betelnut with
leaves, and some others offered Naivaidya. Though, He looked like
living in Shirdi, He was present everywhere. This all-pervasiveness of
His was daily experienced by His devotees. Our humble prostration to
this all-pervasive Sadguru.",
11,2,Doctor Pandit's Worship,"One Dr. Pandit, a friend of Tatyasaheb Noolkar, once came to
Shirdi for Baba’s darshan. After saluting Baba, he sat in the Masjid for
some time. Baba asked him to go to Dadabhat Kelkar. He went to
Dadabhat, by whom he was well received. Then, Dadabhat left his
house for Puja and Dr. Pandit accompanied him. Dadabhat worshipped
Baba. Nobody, until then, dared to apply sandal paste to Baba’s
forehead. Only Mhalsapati used to apply it to His neck. But, this simplehearted,
Dr. Pandit, took Dadabhat’s dish containing Puja-materials
and taking sandal-paste out of it, drew a Tripund, i.e., three horizontal
lines on Baba’s forehead. To the surprise of all, Baba kept silent, not
uttering a single word. Then, Dadabhat, that evening, asked Baba,
“How is it, that, though You object to the sandal-paste, being applied
by others to Your forehead; You allowed Dr. Pandit to do so?” Baba
replied that Dr. Pandit believed Him to be the same as his Guru,
Raghunath Maharaj of Dhopeshwar, known as Kaka Puranik and he
applied the paste to His forehead, as he was doing to his Guru. Hence,
He could not object. On enquiry, Dr. Pandit told Dadabhat that he took
Baba as his Guru Kaka Puranik and realized Him as the same hence,
he marked the Tripund on Baba’s forehead, as he did on his Guru’s.
Though, Baba allowed the devotee to worship Him as they pleased,
still some times, He acted in a strange way. Some times, He threw away
the Puja-dish and was wrath Incarnate, then, who could approach
Him? Some times, He scolded the devotees; at times, He looked softer
than wax, a statue of peace and forgiveness. Though, He seemed to
shake with anger and His red eyes rolled round, still, He was internally,
an ocean of affection and motherly love. He would call out His devotees
and say, that He never knew, when He was ever angry with them. If
it was possible that mothers could kick their children and the sea turn
back the river He too could neglect the devotees’ welfare; that He, the
Slave of His devotees, always stood by them, and responded to them,
whenever they called upon Him and that, He always longed for their
love.",
11,3,Haji Sidik Falke,"There was no knowing, as to when Baba would accept a devotee.
That depended on His will. Siddik Falke’s story is to the point. One
Mohammeden gentleman, by name Siddik Falke of Kalyan, after making
pilgrimage to Mecca and Madina, came to Shirdi. He lived in the
Chavadi, facing north and sat in the open court-yard of the Masjid. For
nine months, Baba ignored him and did not allow him to step into the
Masjid. Falke felt disconsolate and did not know, what to do. Somebody
advised him not to be disappointed but to try to approach Baba through
Shama (Madhavrao Deshpande), a close and intimate devotee of Baba.
He told him that as they approach the Lord Shiva through his servant
and devotee, Nandi, so should Baba be approached through Shama.
Falke liked the idea and implored Shama to intercede for him. Shama
agreed and on a convenient occasion spoke to Baba about him thus,
“Baba, why don’t You allow the old Haji to step into the Masjid, while
so many persons freely come and go, after taking Your darshan; why
not bless him once?” Baba replied, “Shama, you are immature to
understand things. If the Fakir (Allah) does not allow, what can I do?
Without His grace, who will climb into the Masjid? Well, go to him and
ask him, whether he will come to the narrow footpath near the Barvi
well.” Shama went and returned with an affirmative answer. Again
Baba said to Shama, “Ask him, whether he is willing to pay Me the sum
of Rs. 40,000/- in four instalments”. Shama went and returned with the
answer, that he was willing to pay even forty lacs. Again Baba said to
Shama, “We are going to cut a goat in the Masjid, so, ask him, whether
he would like to have its meat haunch or testicles of the goat.” Shama
returned with the answer that the Haji would be happy to receive a
small crumb from Baba’s Kolamba (mudpot). Hearing this, Baba got
excited and with His hands threw away the earthen jars and Kolamba,
and straightway advanced to the Haji and lifting His Kafni up in arms
said, “Why do you brag and pose yourself as an old Haji? Do you read
Quran like this? You are proud of your pilgrimage to Mecca; but you
do not know Me.” Being thus scolded, the Haji was confounded. Baba,
then, went back to the Masjid, purchased a basket of mangoes and sent
them to the Haji. Then again, Baba went to the Haji, and taking out Rs.
55/- from His pocket, gave them in Haji’s hand. Thenceforth, Baba",
11,4,Baba's Control over the Elements,"We shall close this chapter, after describing two incidents, showing
Baba’s control over the elements. (1) Once, at evening time, there was
a terrible storm at Shirdi. The sky was overcast with thick black clouds.
Winds began to blow with great force, clouds roared and lightening
began to flash and rains startedpouring in torrents. In a short time, the
whole place was flooded with water. All creatures, birds, beasts and
men got terribly frightened, and they all flocked to the Masjid for shelter.
There are many local Deities in Shirdi but none of them came to their
rescue. So, they all prayed to Baba – their God, Who was fond of their
devotion, to intercede and quell the storm. Baba was much moved. He
came out and standing at the edge of the Masjid, addressed the storm
in a loud and thunderous voice, “Stop, stop your fury and be calm!”
In a few minutes, the rains subsided, the winds ceased to blow, and the
storm came to a stop. Then, the moon rose in the sky and people went
back home well-pleased. (2) On another occasion at noon the fire in the
Dhuni began to burn brightly, its flames were seen to be reaching the
rafters above.The people who were sitting in the Masjid, did not know,
what do do. They dared not to ask Baba to pour water or do anything
to quench the flames. But Baba soon came to realize, what was
happening. He took up His Satka (short stick) and dashed it against a
pillar in front, saying, “Get down, Be calm”. At each stroke of the Satka,
the flames began to slow down, and in a few minutes the Dhuni became
calm and normal.
This is our Sai, an Incarnation of God. He will bless any man, who
will prostrate and surrender himself to Him. He, who will read the
stories of this chapter daily, with faith and devotion, will soon be free
from all calamities not only this, but always attached and devoted to
Sai, he will get very soon God-vision, all his desires will be fulfilled and
being ultimately desireless, he will attain the Supreme. Amen!
Bow to Shri Sai – Peace be to all",
12,1,Saints' Mission,"We have seen before, that the purpose or object of Divine
Incarnation is to protect the good and destroy the wicked. But, the
mission of the saints is quite different. To them the good and the
wicked are the same. First they draw the evil-doers and set them on
the right path. They are the Agasti1 to destroy the Bhava-sagar (the
ocean of worldly existence) or the sun to destroy the darkness of
ignorance. The God dwells in the saints. In fact, they are not different
from Him. Our Sai is One of these, Who incarnated for the welfare
of the devotees. Supreme in knowledge and surrounded with divine
aura, He loved all beings equally. He was unattached. Foes and
friends, kings and paupers, all were same to Him. Hear His Leelas!
For the sake of devotees, He gave His stock of merits and was ever
alert to help them. But, the devotees could never approach Him,
unless He meant to receive them. If their appointed time did not
come, they did not remember Baba, and His Leelas could not reach
their ears. Then, how could they think of seeing Him? Some men
desired to see Sai Baba, but they did not get any opportunity of
taking His darshan, till His Mahasamadhi. There are many such
persons, whose desire for Baba’s darshan was not thus satisfied.
If these persons, believing in Him, listen to His Leelas, there quest
for darshan will be, to a great extent, satisfied by the Leelas. Even
if some persons went there by sheer luck and took Baba’s darshan,
were they able to stay there longer? No. Nobody could go there of
his own accord and nobody could stay there longer if Baba did not
wish so. They could stay there, so long as Baba pemitted them to
stay, and had to leave the place, when asked to do so by Him so,
everything depended on Baba’s divine will.",
12,2,Kaka Mahajani,"Once, Kaka Mahajani went to Shirdi from Mumbai. He wanted to
stay there for one week and enjoy the Gokul Ashtami festival. As soon
as he took Baba’s darshan, Baba asked him, “When are you returning
home?” He was rather surprised at this question, but he had to give an
answer. He said that he would go home, when He ordered him to do
so. Then, Baba said, “Go tomorrow!” Baba’s word was law and had to
be obeyed. Kaka Mahajani, therefore, left Shirdi, immediately. When he
went to his office in Mumbai, he found his employer anxiously waiting
for him. His Munim, i.e. the manager, suddenly fell ill, hence, Kaka’s
presence was absolutely necessary. He had sent a letter to Kaka at
Shirdi, which was redirected to him at Mumbai.",
12,3,Bhausaheb Dhumal,"Now, listen to another story. Once, Bhausaheb Dhumal was going
to Niphad for a case. On the way, he came to Shirdi, took Baba’s
darshan and wanted to proceed to Niphad immediately. But, Baba did
not premit him to do so. He made him stay at Shirdi, for a week or more.
In the meanwhile, the magistrate at Niphad suffered intensely from
pain in his abdomen and the case was adjourned. Mr. Dhumal was
then, allowed to go and attend to his case. It went on for some months
and was tried by four magistrates. Ultimately, Mr. Dhumal won the case
and his client was acquitted.",
12,4,Mrs. Nimonkar,"Mr. Nanasaheb Nimonkar, Watandar of Nimon and Honorary
magistrate, was staying at Shirdi with his wife. Mr. and Mrs. Nimonkar
were spending most of their time in the Masjid with Baba and serving
Him. It so happened, that their son fell ill at Belapur and the mother
decided, with Baba’s consent, to go to Belapur and see her son and
other relatives, and stay there for a few days, but Mr. Nanasaheb asked
her to return the next day. The lady was in a fix and did not know, what
to do, but her God Sai came to her help. While leaving Shirdi, she went
to Baba, Who was standing in front of Sathe’s wada, with Mr. Nanasaheb
and others, and prostrated at His Feet and asked His permission to go.
Baba said to her, “Go, go quickly, be calm and unperturbed. Stay
comfortably at Belapur for four days! See all your relatives and then
return to Shirdi!” How opportune were Baba’s words! Mr. Nanasaheb’s
proposal was overruled by Baba’s decree.",
12,5,Mule Shastri of Nasik,"An orthodox Agnihotri Brahmin of Nasik, Mule Shastri, who had
studied the six Shastras and was well-versed in astrology and palmistry,
once came to Shirdi to see Mr. Bapusaheb Buti, the famous millionaire
of Nagpur. After seeing him, he and others, went to see Baba in the
Masjid. Baba bought various fruits and other things from vendors with
His own money and distributed them to the people present in the
Masjid. Baba used to press the mango on all sides so skillfully that
when Baba sucked it, he got all the pulp at once in his mouth and could
throw away the seed. Plantains were peeled off by Baba and the pulp
was distributed to the devotees, while the skins were retained by Baba
for Himself. Mule Shastri, as a palmist, wanted to examine Baba’s palm
and asked Him to extend His hand. Baba ignored his request and gave
four plantains to him. Then, they all returned to the Wada and Mule
Shastri bathed, wore fresh clothes and started his routine duties, viz.
Agnihotra etc. Then, Baba as usual started for Lendi and said, “Take
some Geru (i.e. a red miry substance, used to dye clothes in saffroncolour),
we shall today don saffron-coloured cloth. None understood,
what Baba meant. Then after some time, when Baba returned and
preparations for the noon-Arati1 were being made, Bapusaheb Jog asked
Mule Shastri, whether he would accompany him for the Arati. He
replied that he would see Baba in the afternoon. Baba sat on his seat,
was worshipped by the devotees and Arati commenced. Then, Baba
said, “Get some Dakshina from the new (Nasik) Brahmin.” Buti himself
went to the Wada to get the Dakshina and when he gave Baba’s
message to Mule Shastri, he was sorely perplexed. He thought in his
mind thus, “I am a pure Agnihotri Brahmin, why should I pay Dakshina?
Baba may be a great Saint. I am not His dependent.” But, since a great
Saint, like Sai baba was asking for Dakshina through a millionaire like
Buti, he could not refuse. So, leaving his routine unfinished, he started
with Buti for Masjid. Thinking himself holy and the Masjid otherwise,
he remained at a distance, and after joining his palms threw flowers at
Baba from there. Then, lo! all of a sudden, he saw not Baba but his late
Guru Gholap Swami there. He was wonder-struck. Could this be a
dream? No, it was not, as he was wide awake, but how could his late
Guru Gholap be there? He was speechless for some time. He pinched
himself and thought again, but could not reconcile to the fact of his late
Guru Gholap being in the Masjid. Ultimately, leaving aside all doubt,
he went up, fell at his Guru’s feet and then, stood there with folded
hands. Other people sang Baba’s Arati, while Mule Shastri chanted
loudly his Guru’s name. Then, casting off all pride of caste and
sacredness, he fell at his Guru’s feet and closed his eyes. When he got
up and opened his eyes, he saw Baba asking for Dakshina. Seeing
Baba’s blissful form and His inconceivable power, Mule Shastri forgot
himself. He was extremely pleased, his eyes were full of tears of joy. He
again saluted Baba and gave the Dakshina. He said that his doubt was
removed and he saw his own Guru. On seeing this wonderful Leela of
Baba all the people, including Mule Shastri, were much moved and they
realized the meaning of Baba’s words, “Bring Geru, we shall don
saffron-coloured clothes.” Such is the wonderful Leela of Baba.",
12,6,A Doctor's Experience,"Once a Mamlatdar came to Shirdi, with a doctor friend of his. The
doctor said that his Deity was Ram and that, he woud not bow before
a Mohammeden and so, he was unwilling to go to Shirdi. The Mamlatdar
replied, that nobody would press him to bow down. So, he should come
and give the pleasure of his company. Accordingly, they reached Shirdi
and went to the Masjid for Baba’s darshan. All were wonder-struck to
see, the doctor going ahead and saluting Baba. They asked him, how
he forgot his resolve and bowed down to a Mussalman. Then, the
doctor replied that, he saw his beloved Deity, Ram, on the seat and he
therefore, prostrated himself before Him. Then, as he was saying this,
he again saw, Sai Baba there. Being dismayed, he again said, “Is this
a dream? How could He be a Mohammeden? He is a great
Yogasampanna (full of Yoga) Avatar.”
Next day, he made a vow and began to fast. He absented himself
from the Masjid, resolving not to go there, until Baba blessed him. Three
days passed and on the fourth day, a close friend of his, from Khandesh,
turned up; and with him, he went to the Masjid for Baba’s darshan.
After the salutation, Baba asked him, whether anybody had gone to call
him that he had come. Hearing this vital question, the doctor was
moved. The same night he was blessed by Baba and he experienced
Bliss Supreme, in his sleep. Then, he left for his town where he remained
in the same state for a fortnight. Thus, his devotion for Sai Baba increased
manifold.
The moral of all the stories mentioned above, specially, that of
Mule Shastri, is that, we should have firm faith in our Guru and on
none else.
More Leelas of Sai Baba will be described in the next chapter.
Bow to Shri Sai – Peace be to all",
13,1,The Inscrutable Power of Maya,"Baba’s words were always short, deep, full of meaning, effective
and well-balanced. He was ever content and never cared for anything.
He said, “Though I am a Fakir, have no house or wife, and though,
leaving all care, I stay at one place, the inevitable Maya teases Me often.
Though, I forgot Myself but she cannot forget Me. She always envelops
Me. This Maya (illusive power) of the Lord (Shri Hari) harrasses even
Lord Brahma and others, then, what to speak of a poor Fakir, like Me?
Those, who take refuge in God, will be freed from Her clutches with His
grace.”
In such terms Baba spoke about the power of Maya. Lord Shri
Krishna has said to Uddhava in the Bhagwat that the saints are His
living forms and see, what Baba has said for the welfare of His devotees,
“Those, who are fortunate and whose demerits have vanished, take
to My worship. If you always say “Sai, Sai”, I shall take you over the
seven seas believe in these words, and you will be certainly benefitted.
I do not need any paraphernalia of worship – either eight-fold or
sixteen-fold. I rest there, where there is full devotion.” Now, read,
what Sai did for the welfare of those who surrendered themselves to
Him.",
13,2,Bhimaji Patel,"One Bhimaji Patil of Narayangaon, Taluka Junnar, Distt. Poona,’
suffered in the year 1909 from a severe and chronic chest-disease,
which ultimately developed into tuberculosis. He tried all sorts of pathies
(remedies) but to no effect. Losing all hopes, he ultimately prayed to
God, “Oh Lord Narayan, help me now!” It is a well-known fact that,
when our circumstances are well, we do not remember God but when
calamities and adversities overtake us, we are reminded of Him. So,
Bhimaji now turned to God. It occured to him that, he should consult
Mr. Nanasaheb Chandorkar, a great devotee of Baba, in this respect. So,
he wrote to him a letter, giving all details of his malady and asking for
his opinion. In reply, Mr. Nanasaheb wrote to him that, there was only
one remedy left; and that was to take recourse to Baba’s Feet. Relying
on Mr. Nanasaheb’s advice, he made preparations for going to Shirdi.
He was brought to Shirdi and taken to the Masjid and placed before
Baba. Mr Nanasaheb and Shama (Madhavrao Deshpande) were present
there. Baba pointed out that, the disease was due to the previous evil
Karma and was not disposed to interfere. But the patient cried out in
despair that, he was helpless and, sought refuge in Him, as He was his
last hope and prayed for mercy. Baba’s heart melted and He said, “Stay,
cast off your anxiety, your sufferings have come to an end. However,
oppressed and troubled one may be, as soon as he steps in the
Masjid, he is on the pathway to happiness. The Fakir here is very kind
and He will cure the disease and protect all with love and kindness.”
The patient used to vomit blood every five minutes, but there was no
vomitting in the presence of Baba. From the time, Baba uttered the
words of mercy, the malady took a favourable turn. Baba asked him to
stay in Bhimabai’s house, which was not a convenient and fit place but
Baba’s order had to be obeyed. While he was staying there, Baba cured
him by two dreams. In the first dream, he saw himself as a boy, suffering
the severe pain of a flogging, which he received for not reciting his
poetry lesson before his class-master. In the second dream, someone
caused him intense pain by rolling a stone up and down over his chest.
With the pain, thus suffered in dream, his cure was complete and he
went home. He then, often came to Shirdi, gratefully remembering what
Baba did for him and prostrated before Him. Baba also did not expect
anything from devotees but remembrance, unswerving faith and
devotion. People in Maharashtra always celebrate Satya-Narayan Puja
in their homes every fortnight or month but, it was this Bhimaji Patil,
who started a new Sai Satya-vrata Puja, instead of Satya-Narayan-vrata
Puja, in his house, when he returned to his village.",
13,3,Bala Ganpat Shimpi,"Another devotee of Baba, by name Bala Ganpat Shimpi, suffered
much from a malignant type of malaria. He tried all sorts of medicines
and decoctions, but in vain. The fever did not abate a jot and so, he ran
to Shirdi and fell at Baba’s Feet. Baba gave him a strange recipe, in this
case as follows: “Give a black dog some morsels of rice mixed with curd
in front of the Laxmi temple!” Bala did not know, how to execute this
recipe but no sooner he went home, then, he found rice and curd. After
mixing them together, he brought the mixture near the Laxmi temple,
where he found a black dog waving its tail. He placed the curd and rice
before the dog. The dog ate it and, strange to say, Bala got rid of his
malaria.",
13,4,Bapusaheb Buti,"Shriman Bapusaheb Buti suffered, once from dysentery and
vomitting. His cupboard was full of patent drugs and medicines; but
none of them had any effect. Bapusaheb got very weak, on account of
purgings and vomittings and therefore, was not able to go to the Masjid
for Baba’s darshan. Baba then, sent for him and made him sit before
Him and said, “Now, take care, you should not purge any more,” and
gestured with His index-finger, “The vomitting must also stop.” Now,
look at the power of Baba’s words. Both the maladies disappeared and
Buti felt well.
On another occasion, he had an attack of cholera and suffered
from severe thirst. Dr. Pillai tried all sorts of remedies, but could give
him no relief. Then, he went to Baba and consulted Him as, to what to
drink, that would allay his thirst and cure the disease. Baba prescribed
an infusion of almonds, walnuts, pistachio (a kind of dry fruit), boiled
in sugared milk. This would be considered a cause for fatal aggravation
of the disease by any other doctor or physician, but in implicit obedience
to Baba’s order, the infusion was administered and strange to say, the
disease was cured.",
13,5,Alandi Swami,"A Swami from Alandi, with a desire for Baba’s darshan, came to
Shirdi. He suffered from severe pain in his ear, which prevented him
from getting sleep. He was operated for this, but it served no purpose.
The pain was severe and he did not know what to do. While he was
returning, he came to take Baba’s leave, when Shama (Madhavrao
Deshpande) requested Baba to do something for the pain in the Swami’s
ear. Baba comforted him saying, “Allah Accha Karega (God will do
good)!” The Swami, then, returned to Poona, and after a week sent a
letter to Shirdi, stating that the pain in his ear had subsided, though the
swelling was there and in order to get the swelling removed, he went
to Mumbai for operation but the surgeon on examining the ear said that,
no operation was necessary. Such was the wonderful and potent effect
of Baba’s words!",
13,6,Kaka Mahajani's Health,"Another devotee, named Kaka Mahajani, suffered once from
diarrhoea. In order that, there should be no break in his services to
Baba, Kaka kept a Tambya (pot) with water in some corner of the Masjid
and whenever there was a call, he would go out. As Sai Baba knew
everything, Kaka did not inform Him of his disease, thinking that, Baba
would of His own cure it soon. The work of constructing the pavement
in front of the Masjid was permitted by Baba but when the actual work
began, Baba got wild and shouted out loudly. Everybody ran away and
as Kaka was also doing the same, Baba caught hold of him and made
him sit there. In the confusion that followed, somebody left a small
pouch of groundnuts there. Baba took a handful of groundnuts, rubbed
them in His hands, blew away the skins and gave the clean nuts to
Kaka and made him eat them. Scolding and cleaning the nuts and
making Kaka eat them, went on simultaneously. Baba Himself ate some
of them. Then, when the nuts were finished, Baba asked him to fetch
water, as He felt thirsty. Kaka brought a pitcher full of water. Then,
Baba drank some water and made Kaka also drink it. Baba declared,
“Now, your diarrhoea has stopped and you may attend to the work of
the pavement.” In the meanwhile other people, who had run away,
returned and started the work, and Kaka, whose motions had stopped,
also joined them. Are groundnuts medicine for diarrhoea? According to
current medical opinion, groundnuts would aggravate the disease and
not cure it. The true medicine, in this, as in other cases, was Baba’s
word.",
13,7,Dattopant of Harda,"A gentleman from Harda, by name Dattopant, suffered from
stomach-ache for about fourteen years. None of the remedies gave him
any relief. Then, on hearing Baba’s fame, that He cures diseases by
sight, he ran to Shirdi and fell at Baba’s Feet. Baba looked at him kindly
and gave him blessings. When Baba placed His hand on his head and
gave him udi with blessings, he felt relieved and there was no further
trouble about the malady.
Towards the end of this chapter, three cases are cited in footnotes :
1. Madhavrao Deshpande suffered from piles. Baba gave him
decoction of Sonamukhi (senna pods). This relieved him. Then,
after two years the trouble reocurred and Madhavrao took the
same decoction without consulting Baba. The result was that,
the disease aggravated, but later on it was cured by Baba’s
grace.
2. Kaka Mahajani’s elder brother, Gangadharpant, suffered for
many years from stomach-pain. Hearing Baba’s fame he came
to Shirdi and requested Baba to cure him. Baba touched his
belly and said, “God will cure.” From that time, there was, no
stomach-pain and he was completely cured.
3. Nanasaheb Chandorkar also once suffered from acute stomachpain,
he was restless the whole day and night. Doctors
administered injections, which produced no effect. Then he
approached Baba, Who told him to eat burfi (a kind of
sweetmeat) mixed with ghee. This recipe gave him complete
relief.
All these stories show that, the real medicine that cured the various
diseases permanently, was Baba’s word and grace, and not any
medicines or drugs.
